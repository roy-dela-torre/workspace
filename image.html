        "<p>If you’re noticing peeling paint, soft wood, or deterioration around your exterior <a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/windows/"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">window</a> trim, someone
            may suggest “window capping” as a fix. While often marketed as a low-maintenance upgrade, window capping is
            not a recommended solution. In fact, it can create bigger problems over time.</p>

        <p>This article explains what window capping is and why homeowners in Apex, NC should avoid it—regardless of how
            appealing it might seem at first glance.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/June-Blog-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""

        <h2>What Is Window Capping?</h2>

        <p>Window capping involves wrapping exterior wood trim in aluminum or vinyl cladding. The idea is to protect the
            trim from the elements and eliminate the need for repainting. However, capping is typically just a cosmetic
            cover-up—and a risky one.</p>

        <p>It does not address underlying issues like rot or moisture damage. Instead, it often seals problems in and
            lets them worsen out of sight. What seems like a neat, clean solution can become a hidden disaster for your
            window framing and your home’s structure.</p>

        <h2>Why You Should Avoid Window Capping</h2>

        <h3>1. Traps Moisture</h3>

        <p>Even when installed carefully, capping can trap moisture between the cladding and the wood. Once water gets
            in—and it almost always does—it becomes sealed in, unable to escape.</p>

        <p>This creates the perfect conditions for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Wood rot</li>
            <li>Mold and mildew growth</li>
            <li>Long-term structural damage to the frame or sill</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once moisture is locked behind the capping, there is nowhere for it to go.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image3.jpg"" alt="""" width="" 800""

                height="" 600""></p>

        <p><i>Water damage and rot caused to the surrounding structure. This can only be seen after the capping has been
                removed.</i></p>

        <h3>2.Hides Problems Instead of Fixing Them</h3>

        <p>Capping is often promoted as effective <i>if</i> it’s installed with precise cuts, tight seals, and correct
            flashing. But here’s the truth: it’s never done properly—and even when it is, it still fails over time.</p>

        <p>Moisture eventually finds its way behind the capping, no matter how skilled the installer is. Once trapped,
            it accelerates rot and structural damage behind a clean-looking exterior. It’s a short-term, feel-good fix
            that doesn’t actually solve anything.</p>

        <p>In fact, a perfectly installed capping job simply delays the inevitable—and often makes the hidden damage
            worse by masking it until it’s too late.</p>

        <h3>3. Improper Installation Risks</h3>

        <p>For capping to work properly, it must be installed with exact cuts, tight seals, and appropriate flashing to
            direct water away from the home. If any of these details are missed, the result can be worse than doing
            nothing at all. A poor installation may actually funnel water into the wall cavity rather than away from it.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Condensation Issues</h3>

        <p>In colder climates or during seasonal temperature swings, aluminum or metal capping can lead to condensation
            behind the trim. This moisture buildup is not always visible but can:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Soak into the framing</li>
            <li>Freeze in winter and cause cracking</li>
            <li>Create dripping or mold inside your home’s walls</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By the time you notice the damage, it could be extensive and costly.</p>

        <h3>5. Aesthetic Drawbacks</h3>

        <p>Capping adds a layer of material over the original trim, which can make windows look bulky or
            artificial—especially on older homes or those with detailed trim work. It often lacks the charm and
            definition of painted wood and may not blend well with the architectural style of the house.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line for Apex, NC Homeowners</h2>

        <p>Window capping is not a recommended solution. While it may appear to offer short-term savings or convenience,
            it usually leads to much bigger, and costlier, problems down the line. The best approach is to address trim
            issues directly by repairing or replacing damaged wood and preserving proper airflow and drainage.</p>

        <h3>Work With a Contractor Who Prioritizes Real Solutions</h3>

        "<p>Beginning the process of replacing the windows in your home can quickly become overwhelming due to the wide
            array of available options. One of the most frequently misunderstood distinctions is between vinyl windows
            and vinyl-clad windows. Although the terms may appear similar, they describe two distinct types of window
            construction. Gaining clarity on these differences is essential to making a well-informed, lasting
            investment in your home. At Window Works Co., we proudly assist homeowners throughout Holly Springs, NC and

        <h2>What Are Vinyl Windows?</h2>

        <p>Vinyl <a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/windows/"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">windows</a>
            are crafted from PVC (polyvinyl chloride), a type of plastic known for its strength and resistance to the
            elements. Their performance can vary based on the manufacturer’s process, but generally, they offer good
            durability and hold up well against warping, rotting, and everyday wear. If you’ve heard that vinyl windows
            are prone to weather related swelling and warping, you should know that better window manufacturers will
            kiln dry wood prior to manufacture. This, as well as the higher quality wood they’re using, mitigates
            swelling and warping issues. In our Central North Carolina climate—where heat and humidity are a regular
            part of life—vinyl’s moisture resistance and UV stability make it a smart, low-maintenance choice. Plus,
            they’re available in a variety of colors and finishes to complement different styles of homes.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Vinyl Windows:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Cost-Effective:</b> Vinyl windows offer a <b>moderate upfront cost</b>, making them one of the most
                budget-friendly frame materials available. They’re ideal for homeowners looking to balance performance
                with affordability—especially in remodels, rentals, or newer builds where cost is a major consideration.
            </li>
            <li><b>Low Maintenance:</b> With only a moderate degree of maintenance required, vinyl eliminates the need
                for sanding, painting, or staining. A quick wash with soap and water is typically all it takes to keep
                them looking clean and sharp.</li>
            <li><b>Solid Weather Resistance:</b> While not as extreme as fiberglass or aluminum-clad, vinyl windows
                offer moderate durability and weather resistance, effectively standing up to the humidity, heat, and
                seasonal changes common in Central North Carolina. They resist warping, rotting, and moisture absorption
                far better than wood.</li>
            <li><b>Good Long-Term Value:</b> Though not the highest rated in long-term value, vinyl still offers a
                solid, moderate return thanks to its durability, ease of upkeep, and lifetime warranties available from
                many manufacturers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Vinyl windows are a popular choice for homeowners seeking long-lasting performance without the premium price
            tag—especially in newer homes, rental properties, or remodels where budget plays a key role.</p>

        <h2>What Are Vinyl-Clad Windows?</h2>

        <p>Vinyl-clad windows combine the timeless appeal of wood with the practicality of vinyl. These windows feature
            a wood interior, offering the natural warmth and character homeowners love, while the vinyl exterior
            provides a durable barrier against the elements. This dual-material construction makes them a great option
            for those who want the aesthetic of wood without the high maintenance. With strong resistance to weathering
            on the outside and a classic finish on the inside, vinyl-clad windows deliver both beauty and long-term
            performance.</p>

            performance.</p>

        <h3>Why Choose Vinyl-Clad?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Upfront Cost:</b> Vinyl-clad windows fall in the <b>high-moderate</b> range, offering a balance
                between premium appeal and affordability.</li>
            <li><b>Durability & Weather Resistance:</b> With <b>high durability</b>, vinyl-clad windows hold up well
                against the elements—ideal for long-term performance in varied climates.</li>
            <li><b>Low Maintenance:</b> The <b>vinyl exterior</b> requires very little upkeep, freeing you from the
                routine painting or sealing that wood typically demands.</li>
            <li><b>Long-Term Value:</b> These windows deliver <b>high long-term value</b>, thanks to their blend of
                strength, style, and minimal maintenance needs.</li>
            <li><b>Warranty:</b> Most manufacturers offer a <b>20-year warranty</b>, giving homeowners added peace of
                mind with their investment.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Because of the added material complexity and craftsmanship involved, vinyl-clad windows typically come at a
            higher price point than full vinyl. However, many homeowners feel the aesthetic and resale benefits are
            worth it.</p>

        <h2>Vinyl vs. Vinyl-Clad: Which Is Right for Your Holly Springs, NC Home?</h2>

        <p>Here in Holly Springs, NC and other nearby communities, we see a wide variety of home styles—from traditional
            to modern. Your window choice should match not just your budget, but how you live in your home and how long
            you plan to stay.</p>

        <h3>Choose Vinyl Windows If You:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Want a cost-effective, long-term solution for energy efficiency and comfort</li>
            <li>Prefer a low-maintenance lifestyle—no sanding, painting, or worry</li>
            <li>Are updating windows in a rental property, vacation home, or modern design</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Choose Vinyl-Clad Windows If You:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Value the classic, warm appearance of wood interiors</li>
            <li>Are renovating or preserving a historic or custom-built home</li>
            <li>Want to enhance aesthetic appeal for resale or long-term pride of ownership</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Climate Considerations in the Holly Springs, NC Area</h2>

        <p>North Carolina sees its fair share of hot, humid summers, unexpected downpours, and seasonal shifts that can
            challenge your windows over time.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Vinyl windows perform very well in humid conditions. They won’t absorb moisture or crack from thermal
                expansion.</li>
            <li>Vinyl-clad windows offer similar weather resistance on the exterior—but the interior wood may still need
                some occasional maintenance.</li>
        </ul>

        "<p>We all love a good deal, and the allure of “50% off windows!” or “Buy one, get one free!” can be incredibly
            tempting, especially when you’re tackling a home renovation project. However, when it comes to a significant
            investment like new windows, that enticing sale price might be making up for subpar windows that could end
            up costing you significantly more down the line. Before you jump at that seemingly fantastic offer, let’s
            delve into why you should seriously rethink buying windows for your Cary, NC home solely based on a sale.
        </p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mar-Blog2.jpg"" alt="""" width="" 500""
                height="" 750""></p>

        <h3>The Hidden Costs Behind the Discount:</h3>

        <p>Often, deeply discounted windows achieve their low price point by compromising on key technical
            specifications that directly impact their performance, longevity, and ultimately, your wallet. Here’s a
            breakdown of what you might be sacrificing:</p>

        <h4>Lower Quality Materials</h4>

        <p><b>Vinyl Composition:</b> Cheaper vinyl formulations might be less durable, more prone to warping, cracking,
            and fading under UV exposure. This means they won’t last as long and will likely require replacement sooner.
            For example, a premium vinyl might contain stabilizers and impact modifiers that a budget-friendly option
            lacks.</p>

        <p><b>Frame Construction:</b> The internal structure and welding of the frame can be weaker in cheaper windows.
            This can lead to air and water leaks, reducing energy efficiency and potentially causing structural issues
            over time. Look for fusion-welded corners rather than mechanically joined ones for superior strength and
            sealing.</p>

        <p><b>Hardware:</b> Hinges, locks, and handles on discounted windows are often made from lower-grade metals that
            can corrode, break, or become stiff more easily. Replacing these components can be a hassle and an added
            expense. Consider the material of the hardware (e.g., stainless steel vs. zinc alloy) and its warranty.</p>

        <h4>Inferior Glazing</h4>

        <p><b>Glass Thickness:</b> Thinner glass panes offer less insulation and sound dampening compared to thicker
            options. While a standard double-pane window might have two 3mm glass panes, a higher-quality one might use
            4mm or even incorporate a laminated layer for better performance.</p>

        <p><b>Low-E Coatings:</b> Low-emissivity (Low-E) coatings are crucial for energy efficiency, reflecting heat and
            reducing UV rays. Cheaper windows might have a basic, less effective Low-E coating or even lack it entirely.
            Look for windows with specific Low-E coatings designed for your climate. <a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/energy-efficient-windows/"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">The
                U-factor and Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) ratings will indicate the effectiveness of the
                glazing. </a></p>

        <p><b>Gas Fills:</b> The space between the glass panes is often filled with inert gases like argon or krypton to
            further enhance insulation. Discounted windows might use less gas, a lower-quality gas, or even just air,
            significantly reducing their energy efficiency. <a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/fog-between-the-windows-whats-normal-and-whats-not-when-it-comes-to-moisture-between-your-window-panes/""
                target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">These lower-quality windows may be more prone to seal failure. </a>
        </p>

        <h4>Compromised Energy Efficiency</h4>

        <p><b>U-Factor:</b> This measures how well a window insulates (lower is better). Sale windows might have a
            higher U-factor, meaning more heat loss in winter and heat gain in summer, leading to increased energy
            bills.</p>

        <p><b>Air Leakage:</b> Poorly constructed or installed windows can have significant air leakage, measured in
            cubic feet per minute per linear foot of crack (cfm/ft). Discounted windows often have higher air leakage
            rates, making your home drafty and further increasing energy costs.</p>

        <h4>Installation Shortcuts</h4>

        <p>The “sale” price might not include proper installation, or it might be performed by less experienced
            installers. As we always say “<b>Even the best window will fail if it’s installed improperly”.</b>Poor
            installation can negate the benefits of even high-quality windows, leading to air and water leaks,
            operational issues, and voided warranties. Always inquire about the installer’s qualifications, insurance,
            and experience.</p>

        <h3>Beyond the Initial Price Tag</h3>

        <p>While the upfront discount might seem appealing, consider the long-term implications:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Higher Energy Bills:</b> Inefficient windows will force your HVAC system to work harder, resulting in
                significantly higher monthly energy bills.</li>
            <li><b>Reduced Comfort:</b> Drafty windows and inconsistent temperatures can make your home less comfortable
                year-round.</li>
            <li><b>Lower Home Value:</b> Investing in quality, energy-efficient windows can increase your home’s value.
                Cheap windows can have the opposite effect.</li>
            <li><b>More Frequent Repairs and Replacements:</b> As mentioned earlier, lower-quality materials and
                construction often lead to premature failure, costing you more money and time spent on repairs and
                replacements in the long run.</li>
            <li><b>Voided or Limited Warranties:</b> Deeply discounted windows might come with limited or no warranties,
                leaving you vulnerable to repair or replacement costs if issues arise. Always carefully review the
                warranty terms and coverage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to Look for Instead</h3>

        <p>Instead of solely focusing on the discount, prioritize these factors when choosing new windows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Energy Efficiency Ratings:</b> Look for the NFRC (National Fenestration Rating Council) label, which
                provides standardized ratings for U-factor, Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC), Visible Transmittance
                (VT), and Air Leakage (AL).</li>
            <li><b>Material Quality:</b> Research the different frame materials (vinyl, wood, aluminum, fiberglass) and
                their pros and cons. Understand the composition and construction details.</li>
            <li><b>Glazing Options:</b> Explore different Low-E coatings, gas fills, and glass thicknesses to find the
                best fit for your climate and needs.</li>
            <li><b>Reputable Manufacturers and Installers:</b> Choose windows from established manufacturers with good
                reputations and ensure they are installed by qualified and experienced professionals. Check online
                reviews and ask for references.</li>
            <li><b>Comprehensive Warranties:</b> Understand the warranty coverage, including the duration and what it
                covers (frame, glass, hardware).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>In Conclusion</h3>

        <p>While a sale on windows might seem like a great opportunity, it’s crucial to look beyond the price tag and
            carefully evaluate the technical specifications and long-term costs. Investing in higher-quality,
            energy-efficient windows from a reputable source, even if they aren’t heavily discounted, will likely save
            you money and provide greater comfort and peace of mind in the long run. Don’t let a tempting sale price
            blind you to the potential hidden costs and compromises.</p>

        "<p>When it comes time to <a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/windows/"" target="" _blank"" rel=""
                noopener"">replace your windows</a>, you may have heard of two primary installation methods: full frame
            and pocket window installations. These two approaches differ significantly in how much of the existing
            window setup gets removed and replaced, and understanding the differences can help you make the best choice
            for your home in Holly Springs, NC. One of the most common concerns homeowners have about full-frame
            installations is the removal of inside trim. Many homeowners are concerned about losing the cozy look of
            their current trim, but understanding what each installation process involves can help ease those concerns.
            In this post, we’ll break down the key differences between full-frame and pocket window installation and
            discuss exactly what gets removed during each process. <img src=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Feb-blog-2.jpg"" alt="""" width="" 500""
                height="" 750""></p>

        <h3>What Is Full Frame Window Installation?</h3>

        <p>A full-frame window installation is a thorough process in which the entire existing window, including the
            frame, trim, and sill, is removed. Everything from the old window to the surrounding components is taken
            out. New materials, starting from the studs, are installed, creating a completely new window opening.  The
            benefits of a full-frame installation include better energy efficiency and a more secure, long-lasting
            window. This method is particularly useful if your window frames are rotting or damaged or if you want to
            change the size of your window opening. Full-frame installations also allow additional insulation to be
            added around the window, which can significantly reduce drafts and help keep your home’s temperature stable.
            However, as you might expect, full-frame installation involves removing more parts of your window setup,
            including the trim. Many homeowners are initially concerned about the removal of interior trim, as it can
            leave the room looking unfinished temporarily. But rest assured, your new window will come with new trim,
            and the result will often be more aesthetically pleasing and energy-efficient.</p>

        <h3>What Is Pocket Window Installation?</h3>

        <p>In contrast to full-frame installations, a pocket window installation keeps the original frame in place. In
            this process, only the old window sash (the part that opens and closes) is removed, and a new window is
            fitted into the existing frame. The trim and other surrounding elements typically remain intact. Pocket
            window installations are less disruptive than full-frame replacements, and as a result, they tend to be
            quicker and more affordable. If you’re happy with the condition of your existing window frame and don’t want
            to disturb the interior trim or window sill, a pocket installation might be the best option. However, pocket
            installations can sometimes leave you with less insulation and may not provide as tight of a seal as
            full-frame windows. If the original frame is in good condition, though, pocket windows can be an effective
            solution. They do, however,  reduce the size of the glass portion of the window, which may make them
            impractical for smaller windows.</p>

        <h3>What Gets Removed During Full-Frame Installation?</h3>

        <p>One of the biggest points of concern for homeowners considering full-frame window installations is the
            removal of interior trim. Here’s what typically gets removed:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Interior Trim:</b> The trim around the window is typically removed during a full-frame installation.
                Many homeowners appreciate this step because it gives the room a fresh look and allows new, custom trim
                to be installed that matches your desired style.</li>
            <li><b>Existing Window Frame:</b> The old window frame is completely removed, even if it’s still in good
                condition as it allows for a better, more secure installation of the new window. This ensures that
                everything fits properly and helps prevent any potential problems in the future.</li>
            <li><b>Sill:</b> The sill will always be removed during a full-frame installation.</li>
            <li><b>Old Window Sash:</b> As with any window replacement, the old window sash (the movable part of the
                window) is taken out and replaced with a new, energy-efficient unit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Stays in Place During Pocket Installation?</h3>

        <p>During a pocket window installation, there’s much less removal. Here’s what typically stays in place:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Interior Trim:</b> One of the biggest selling points of a pocket installation is that the interior
                trim usually stays intact. Homeowners who want to preserve the look of their trim without having to redo
                the surrounding area often opt for this method.</li>
            <li><b>Window Frame:</b> The existing frame remains in place. It can be reused for the new window
                installation as long as it’s in good condition,</li>
            <li><b>Sill:</b> If the sill is in decent shape, it remains undisturbed. The existing one is often reused;
                however, a new one may be added if necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Which Installation Method Is Right for You?</h3>

        <p>Choosing between full-frame and pocket window installation depends on several factors:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Condition of Your Current Window Frame:</b> A full-frame installation is often necessary to ensure
                long-term stability if the frame is damaged or deteriorating,</li>
            <li><b>Budget and Time Constraints:</b> Pocket window installations are typically more affordable and
                quicker to complete because they involve less removal and work.</li>
            <li><b>Aesthetic Preferences:</b> If you want to update the look of your window area and are willing to
                sacrifice your current trim, a full-frame installation can provide a fresh look and better energy
                efficiency.</li>
            <li><b>Energy Efficiency Needs:</b> Full-frame installations offer the potential for better insulation and a
                tighter seal, making them a more energy-efficient option in some cases.</li>
        </ul>

        "<p>When building your dream home, it’s easy to get excited about installing that stunning <a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/doors/"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">front door</a>. But
            experienced contractors—especially those focused on quality and craftsmanship, like Window Works Co.—know
            that the permanent front entry should be one of the <i>last</i> things installed. Instead, most pros rely on
            a temporary solution known as a dunnage door during earlier construction phases.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/June-Blog-2-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""
                1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>What Is a Dunnage Door?</h2>

        <p>A dunnage door is a temporary, functional door installed in the rough opening where the permanent front door
            will eventually go. It’s typically made of inexpensive materials like plywood or hollow-core slabs and is
            meant to take all the abuse of the construction site—dings, dirt, moisture, and heavy traffic—so your actual
            front door doesn’t have to.</p>

        <p>This low-cost stand-in allows tradespeople to enter and secure the site while protecting your final entryway
            investment from damage, warping, or misalignment. Once the interior is nearing completion, the dunnage door
            is rem oved and replaced with your high-end, properly fitted front door.</p>

        <h2>Why Wait to Install the Front Door?</h2>

        <p>Delaying the installation of the final front door isn’t about procrastination—it’s about protection,
            precision, and presentation. Below are several reasons why we recommend waiting until the end of the
            project:</p>

        <p>1. To Prevent Damage from Ongoing Work</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Trades like drywallers, painters, and flooring crews can accidentally scuff or damage doors.</li>
            <li>High-end wood or glass doors are especially vulnerable to scratches, dents, or even warping from
                premature exposure.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>2. Avoiding Weather Exposure</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In early construction stages, homes are not fully sealed against the elements.</li>
            <li>Moisture intrusion can damage door finishes or cause swelling, particularly in wood doors.</li>
            <li>Delaying installation helps maintain material integrity and function.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>4. Ensuring Final Elevations Are Set</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Exterior elements like porches, stoops, and final flooring heights must be finalized before accurate
                threshold placement.</li>
            <li>Installing the front door too early could result in misalignment or the need for costly rework.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>5. Precision in Trim and Finish Work</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Painters, siding installers, and trim carpenters require access around the door area.</li>
            <li>A finished door installed too early can interfere with these processes or be inadvertently painted or
                sprayed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>6. Curb Appeal at Final Walkthrough</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A freshly installed, undamaged front door gives an excellent first impression.</li>
            <li>For custom homes, a flawless entryway is part of the “wow” factor during buyer walkthroughs or
                inspections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Dunnage Doors Should Be Used</h2>

        <p>We recommend using temporary doors, often referred to as dunnage doors. These are designed to offer security
            for tools, equipment, and other items inside the home, but since they’re intended for temporary use, it’s
            not a problem if they get scratched or dented.</p>

        <h2>When Does the Real Door Go In?</h2>

        <p>Only after these major steps are complete should your permanent front door be installed:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Site grading and foundation curing</li>
            <li>Framing and roof system (“dry-in”)</li>
            <li>Rough-ins for plumbing, HVAC, and electrical</li>
            <li>Window and siding installation</li>
            <li>Insulation and drywall prep</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At that point, your real front door can be installed with care and precision—looking perfect and performing
            flawlessly for years to come.</p>

        <h2>Building a New Home?</h2>

        <p>If your builder is insisting on installing doors early without taking these crucial steps into consideration,
            it’s a good idea to have a discussion with them. For expert <a href=""

        "<p>When shopping for a new <a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/doors/"" target="" _blank"" rel=""
                noopener"">exterior door</a>, you’ll often run into technical terms like <i>pultrusion</i> and
            <i>extrusion</i>. These terms describe how the materials in your door frame are manufactured—and
            understanding them can help you feel more confident in your decision.</p>

        <p>At Window Works Co., we believe that informed homeowners make the best choices, so here’s a quick guide to
            what these terms mean and how they relate to the durability and performance of your new door.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image2.jpg"" alt="""" width="" 1000""
                height="" 1500""></p>

        <h3>What Is Extrusion?</h3>

        <p>Extrusion is a process in which a molten material, like Aluminum, is pushed through a mold to create a
            specific shape. Once formed, the material is cooled and cut to length. This method allows for great design
            flexibility and efficient production.</p>

        <p>Extruded materials are commonly used in door and window frames and can offer excellent performance,
            especially when properly installed and maintained.</p>

        <h3>What Is Pultrusion?</h3>

        <p>Pultrusion is a manufacturing process where continuous strands of a fibrous material, like fiberglass are
            pulled through a resin bath. They are then heated to form a rigid, reinforced shape. The result is a dense,
            highly durable material often used for structural parts of doors and windows.</p>

        <p>Pultrusion is known for producing components with high strength, excellent thermal performance, and
            resistance to warping or moisture damage.</p>

        <h3>Materials Used in Pultrusion and Extrusion</h3>

        <p>Both extrusion and pultrusion methods can be used to manufacture parts made from:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fiberglass</li>
            <li>Aluminum</li>
            <li>Vinyl</li>
            <li>Composite materials</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The choice of material, along with the manufacturing process, contributes to the overall performance of the
            door or window component.</p>

        <h3>So, Which Is Better?</h3>

        <p>The truth is—there’s no “better” option. Both pultruded and extruded components can be used to build strong,
            energy-efficient, and long-lasting doors.  Both processes aim to create profiles that are often used to
            construct doors with clean lines and smooth finishes. Manufacturers will prime and paint these doors,
            further obscuring any subtle differences in the raw material’s surface texture or grain. The best choice
            often comes down to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your design preferences</li>
            <li>Where the door will be installed</li>
            <li>The material used in the frame</li>
            <li>Your budget and project goals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Morrisville Homeowners Are Rethinking Their Patio Doors</h3>

        <p>Traditional patio doors can be limited in function and style. They’re often hard to slide, look outdated, and
            don’t open very wide. Over time, the heat and humidity here in the Triangle can make things worse—causing
            them to stick, wear out, and lose their efficiency.</p>

        <p>Bifold and stack-and-slide doors offer a refreshing alternative. These aren’t just replacements—they’re
            upgrades that redefine how you experience your home.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Bifold doors</b> fold back like an accordion, allowing for a completely open wall.</li>
            <li><b>Stack-and-slide doors</b> glide and stack smoothly behind each other, creating a wide, uninterrupted
                view.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Both styles create a seamless flow between your indoor and outdoor spaces, making your home feel larger,
            brighter, and more connected to the outside world—especially during spring.</p>

        <h3>The Appeal of Bifold Doors</h3>

        <p>Picture a sunny spring afternoon with your doors folded open, merging your indoor living room with your
            outdoor patio. Bifold doors are ideal for homeowners who appreciate:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Expansive, fully open spaces</li>
            <li>A contemporary, streamlined appearance</li>
            <li>A striking architectural element</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They work best in homes with enough clearance to allow for the panels to fold outward. For those who love to
            entertain or simply enjoy open, airy environments, bifold doors deliver both style and functionality.</p>

        <h3>Stack-and-Slide Doors: Effortless Style and Versatility</h3>

        <p>If space is a concern or you prefer a sliding system, stack-and-slide doors are a sleek and versatile
            solution. These doors operate on a smooth track, with panels that slide and stack neatly behind one another.
        </p>

        <p>Key advantages include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A minimalist design that fits most home styles</li>
            <li>Easy operation for all family members</li>
            <li>A space-efficient footprint, ideal for tighter areas</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This option offers the benefits of expansive views and generous access without the need for exterior
            clearance, making it well-suited for patios of all sizes.</p>

        <h3>Considering a 4-Panel Slider?</h3>

        <p>For homeowners seeking a more traditional but updated solution, a 4-panel sliding glass door remains a
            reliable choice. It’s an excellent middle ground for those who want:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Increased natural light</li>
            <li>A broader view of the outdoors</li>
            <li>Functional, no-fuss access to patios and yards</li>
            <li>A more affordable alternative</li>
        </ul>

        <p>While it may not open as fully as bifold or stack-and-slide models, it’s a significant improvement over
            older, standard sliding doors.</p>

                noopener"">new patio door</a> for your home, you may be unsure whether a slider or a hinged door is the
            better choice. Both options are popular, but they function in different ways. In this article, we’ll help

        <h4>What is a Slider Patio Door?</h4>

        <p>A slider patio door operates by sliding open and closed, similar to a large window on wheels. It has two or
            more large glass panels, and you can opt for both to open or just one to operate while the other remains
            fixed. This style is simple to use and doesn’t take up much space.</p>

        <h4>What is a Hinged Patio Door?</h4>

        <p>A hinged patio door is the traditional type that opens like a regular door, swinging in or out. These doors
            usually have two panels that open from the center, much like French doors. You can choose whether you want
            both doors operational or one may be non-operational, essentially functioning as a door-shaped window.</p>

        <h4>How to Choose the Right Patio Door for Your Home</h4>

        <p>The choice between a slider door and a hinged door depends on the needs of your home and the available space.
            Here are some factors to consider when making the decision:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>For Small Spaces:</b> The slider door is recommended for limited space. It doesn’t require extra
                space to open, making it ideal for smaller yards or patios.</li>
            <li><b>For a Classic Look:</b>Hinged doors offer a sophisticated design, making them an excellent choice for
                traditional homes.</li>
            <li><b>For a Modern Look:</b> Slider doors offer a sleek, modern design with clean lines, making them a
                perfect fit for homes with a contemporary style.</li>
            <li><b>For Energy Efficiency.</b> Both slider and hinged doors can have energy-efficiency glass, which helps
                your home stay cool and at a comfortable temperature all year.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mar-Blog1-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""
                500"" height="" 750""></h4>

        <h4>Final Thoughts: Which Door is Best?</h4>

        <p>To sum it up, here’s how to decide which patio door is best for you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Choose a slider door</b> if you need to save space and like a simple, modern look.</li>
            <li><b>Choose a hinged door</b> if you want a classic and fancy style.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can see that both slider and hinged patio doors have their good points. The best door for you depends on
            what you need for your home and how much space you have. Whether you choose a slider or a hinged door, both
            options will make your home more open and inviting.</p>

        "<p>When you’re looking to replace the doors in your home, it’s easy to consider buying them online. The idea of
            browsing through a wide selection, comparing prices, and having the door shipped directly to your house
            sounds convenient, right? However, purchasing doors online without the support of a local professional can
            lead to unexpected issues that may cost you more time, money, and hassle in the long run. At Window Works
            Co., we believe in the value of local expertise and peace of mind through working with professionals. Before
            you make that online purchase, let’s explore why it’s crucial to consider local help when buying and <a

                doors</a>.</p>

        <h3>No Expert Help</h3>

        <p>One of the greatest advantages of working with a local door installation company like Window Works Co. is
            access to expert advice tailored to your needs. When shopping online, you may be left to figure out which
            door is the best for your home. You might not be sure what material, style, or design will complement your
            home’s look or which type of door will offer the security and durability you need.</p>

        <p>Local experts, on the other hand, are well-versed in the best choices for your area’s climate, architecture,
            and personal style. They can offer personalized recommendations based on your preferences and guide you
            through the many options. This hands-on, professional support helps you choose the perfect door for
            functionality and aesthetics.</p>

        <h3>Installation is Key</h3>

        <p>Although purchasing a door online might seem straightforward, the installation process can be far more
            complex than expected. Many top installation professionals won’t install a door that wasn’t purchased from
            them (we won’t). So, if you buy a door online, you are limited in who can install it. Many people
            underestimate the challenges involved in properly installing a door. If a door isn’t installed properly, it
            can lead to problems such as air leaks, drafts, or even security concerns. Additionally, poor installation
            can damage the frame or create issues with the door’s function, like trouble locking or closing it.</p>

        <p>With local experts like Window Works Co., you can rest assured that your door will be installed correctly.
            Our trained technicians have years of experience handling all types of doors. We ensure that everything fits
            perfectly, operates smoothly, and provides the security and energy efficiency your home needs.</p>

        <h3>Warranties and Support</h3>

        <p>Another challenge of buying a door online is dealing with potential warranty or support issues. Most top
            installation companies won’t service a door that wasn’t purchased from them (again, we won’t); we frequently
            hear from people who purchased a custom door online are having mechanical issues, and are struggling to find
            someone willing to work on the door. If something goes wrong—whether it’s a manufacturing defect, shipping
            damage, or just an issue with the door itself—you may find it difficult to fix the problem. Returning a
            large item like a door is often a hassle, and many online retailers may not provide the customer service you
            need.</p>

        <p>With a local company like Window Works Co., you’ll have a team you can rely on for help. If something goes
            wrong with your door after purchase or installation, we are here to quickly and easily address the issue.
        </p>

        <h3>Better Quality Assurance</h3>

        <p>While online stores may offer a variety of doors, you can’t always be certain about the quality of the
            product you’re purchasing. There’s a risk that the door might not live up to your expectations or be durable
            enough for your needs. Online retailers may sell doors from various manufacturers, and the quality can vary
            significantly.</p>

        <p>When you buy from a local company like Window Works Co., you’re getting a product that has been carefully
            selected for quality. We work only with trusted manufacturers who produce doors we can stand behind. Our
            reputation is built on delivering high-quality products that are durable, secure, and built to last, so you
            can be confident that you’re investing in a door that will serve you for years to come.</p>

        <h3>Personalized Choices</h3>

        <p>While buying a door online offers many choices, it can be difficult to find the perfect one. You might find a
            door that looks appealing, but it may not suit your home’s style or limited customization. Additionally, you
            may face long shipping delays or a complicated ordering process.</p>

        <p>Local companies like Window Works Co. offer much more flexibility. We can work with you to customize your
            door, whether you’re looking for a specific color, material, design, or unique features. Additionally, our
            team ensures that the final product aligns with your vision and requirements.</p>

            brass, and aluminum, and can be finished in polished, matte, or textured styles to match different interior

                height="" 1500""></p>

        <h3>Why Are Long Door Handles Trending in 2025?</h3>

        <p>Home design trends often evolve based on a combination of aesthetics and functionality, and long door handles
            strike the perfect balance between the two. Here’s why they’re so popular:</p>

        <p><b>1.  Modern Elegance</b>: Long handles add a contemporary touch to any door. Their clean lines and extended
            length create a bold, upscale look.</p>

        <p><b>2. Enhanced Functionality</b>: These handles are not just about looks—they’re also easier to grip and
            operate, making them ideal for home residents of any age, from children to older homeowners.</p>

        <p><b>3. Versatility</b>: Long handles work beautifully on various door styles, from sleek glass entry doors to
            traditional wood panels, allowing you to customize your look.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Long Door Handles</h3>

        <p>Adding long door handles to your home is about more than just following a trend. Here are some key benefits
            that homeowners in Cary, NC, can enjoy:</p>

        <p><b>1. Improved Accessibility.</b>Long handles are easier to grasp, making them a great option for families
            with children or elderly members. They require less precision to operate, which is especially helpful for
            those with mobility challenges.</p>

        <p><b>2. Aesthetic Appeal.</b>These handles create a sense of proportion and balance on taller or wider doors,
            making your home feel more sophisticated and cohesive. They can also act as a statement piece, drawing
            attention to your entryways.</p>

        <p><b>3. Durability and Quality.</b>Many long door handles are crafted from high-quality materials like
            stainless steel, brass, or bronze. Their sturdy construction ensures they’ll stand the test of time, even
            with heavy use.</p>

        <p><b>4. Design Versatility.</b>From minimalist to ornate styles, long handles come in various finishes and
            designs. Whether your home has a modern or classic aesthetic, you’ll find an option that complements your
            space perfectly.</p>

        <h3>Choosing the Perfect Long Door Handle</h3>

        <p>With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to select the right long door handle for your home.
            Here are five steps to make the process easier:</p>

        <p><b>1. Consider the Door Style.</b>Your handle should complement the door’s design. For example, a sleek,
            polished stainless-steel handle pairs beautifully with contemporary smooth fiberglass doors, while a matte
            black or oil-rubbed bronze finish suits rustic wooden doors.</p>

        <p><b>2. Match Your Home’s Aesthetic.</b>Think about your home’s overall style. Long door handles can either
            blend seamlessly into your design or act as a focal point. Decide which approach works best for your space.
        </p>

        <p><b>3. Choose the Right Length.</b>Not all long handles are created equal. Measure your door and select a
            handle length that feels proportional. A handle that’s too short can look out of place, while an overly long
            one may overwhelm the door.</p>

        <p><b>4. Select the Finish.</b>The finish of your handle should coordinate with other hardware in your home,
            such as light fixtures, cabinet pulls, and faucets. Popular finishes for 2025 include matte black, brushed
            nickel, and aged brass.</p>

        <p><b>5. Prioritize Quality.</b>Invest in high-quality materials and craftsmanship. A well-made handle not only
            lasts longer but also maintains its finish and functionality over time.</p>

        <h3>Where to Use Long Door Handles</h3>

        <p>Long door handles aren’t limited to entry doors. Here are some areas where they can make an impact:</p>

        <p><b>Patio Doors</b>: Long handles add elegance and ease of use to sliding or French doors.</p>

        <p><b>Interior Doors</b>: Use them on tall or statement doors inside your home for a cohesive design.</p>

        <p><b>Closet Doors</b>: Upgrade your walk-in closet with sleek, modern handles for a touch of luxury.</p>

        "<p>Even the best window will fail if it’s not installed properly.</p>

        <p>Watch the video below to see an example of this.</p>

        <p>The video shows footage of an <a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/windows/"">Andersen E-series
                window</a> that we sold to a homeowner.</p>

        <p>The window is an aluminum-clad product, considered top-of-the-line.</p>

        <p>But, the homeowners noticed that it was leaking. They worried that their window wasn’t sound.</p>

        <p>We performed a water test, in which we sprayed water at specific points on and around the window to determine
            where the leak occurred.</p>

        <p>The water test confirmed our theory; the window was sound. But, because some rot around the window hadn’t
            been repaired when the previous window was replaced, there was water infiltration.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, this was an easy fix for the homeowners. Once the rot was repaired, the window no longer leaked.
        </p>

        <p>This video highlights that a window is only as good as how well it is installed. Bad installation can cause
            any window to fail.</p>

            protective gear, clean up the area as best you can to ensure that no one is injured by broken glass shards.
        </p>

        <p>Next, check the panel and frame Integrity. Inspect to determine if the door panel and frame are damaged.
            Consider also if the broken glass is causing any structural instability.</p>

        <h2>2. Secure the Area</h2>

        <p>If the damage is extensive, temporarily secure the area with plywood or similar material to prevent
            unauthorized entry.</p>

        <p>Consider using plastic sheeting to protect the interior from the elements depending on the weather.</p>

        <h2>3. Contact Your Insurance Provider</h2>

        <p>If you have homeowners’ insurance, contact your provider as soon as possible. They can guide you through the
            claims process and determine your coverage.</p>

        <p>You’ll want to be sure to gather any relevant documentation, such as photos of the damage or video showing
            how the damage occurred.</p>

        <h2>4. Determine if You Need to Replace the Door or just the Glass</h2>

        <p>In Step 1, you assessed if the frame or panel of the door was damaged, or if just the glass was broken. The
            answer to this question will determine what kind of professional will help you fix your door.</p>

        <p>If <strong>just the glass in your front door is broken</strong>, and the door frame is undamaged, <strong>you
                need a glazier</strong>. A glazier is a glass professional who can patch small areas of damage to glass.
            They can also replace larger pieces of glass if the damage is widespread.</p>

        <p>If, however, your <strong>door frame or panel is also damaged</strong>, you may want to consider
            <strong>replacing your whole door</strong>. That’s because damage to these door parts can make your door
            more susceptible to weathering, rot, and warp over time. If the damage is limited to surface-level scratches
            you may be able to address this through sanding and refinishing. However, any more significant damage may
            warrant replacing your door.</p>

        "<p>Holly Springs, North Carolina, is a great place to live. However, our humid climate presents unique
            challenges for homeowners, especially when it comes to building materials. While wood doors offer a classic
            aesthetic appeal, they may not be the best choice for central NC. Here are the 5 hidden costs of wood doors
            that we warn homeowners about in our <a href="" /doors"">Holly Springs, NC door store</a>.</p>

        <p><img src=""

                alt="" greige stone and sided house with a wood door with sidelites captioned with "" Can you actually
                afford a wood door? The 5 hidden costs of a wood door"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>1. Humidity-related Repair Costs</h2>

        <p>Holly Springs’s humid climate can wreak havoc on wood doors. The constant exposure to moisture can lead to
            warping, swelling, and rotting. These issues not only compromise the door’s appearance but also its
            functionality and security.</p>

        <h2>2. More Frequent Maintenance</h2>

        <p>Wood doors demand significant upkeep to maintain their beauty and integrity. Regular painting, staining, and
            sealing are essential to protect the wood from the elements. This time-consuming and costly maintenance can
            be a major drawback for many homeowners.</p>

        <h2>3. Pest Prevention</h2>

        <p>Termites and other wood-boring insects thrive in Holly Springs’s warm, humid conditions. Wood doors provide
            an irresistible feast for these pests, leading to costly repairs or even door replacement. Choosing a wood
            door in central North Carolina means always being on the lookout for signs of damaging pests. This damage
            can become costly, and can jeopardize your door’s function and security,</p>

        <h2>4. Boosted Energy Bills</h2>

        <p>Modern materials like fiberglass and composite doors offer superior insulation compared to wood. This can
            lead to significant energy savings by reducing heat transfer and improving indoor comfort.</p>

        <h2>5. Warranty Woes can be the Highest Hidden Costs of Wood Doors</h2>

        <p>While fiberglass doors generally have a 20+ year warranty, most wood doors have a warranty that only lasts
            1-3 years. The longest-lasting warranty we’ve ever seen on a wood door is 5 years.</p>

        <p>It’s also worth noting that many wood door warranties specify that wood doors must be installed under an
            overhang (like an awning or porch ceiling). If they aren’t, it typically voids the warranty.</p>

        <p>If you’re counting on your door warranty to reduce your door-related costs, you may want to reconsider a wood
            door.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, you’ll be facing the biggest cost related to a wood door; the cost of replacing it.</p>

        <p>While wood doors may have a timeless appeal, the challenges posed by Holly Springs’ climate, coupled with
            maintenance requirements and potential security issues, make them a less-than-ideal choice for many
            homeowners. Fortunately, there are a wide array of highly durable fiberglass door options that flawlessly
            mimic the look of wood without the additional hassle and cost.</p>

        "<p>You’re in the market for a new front door and see the term “wood door” everywhere. But what exactly does
            that mean? Oftentimes homeowners visiting our <a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/"" target="" _blank""
                rel="" noopener"">Raleigh, NC door showroom </a>believe that ‘wood door’ will be made entirely from a
            single piece of wood harvested from one tree. But is that really the case?</p>

        <h3>The Short Answer: Often, No.</h3>

        <p>While the term “wood door” might conjure up images of a solid block of oak, the reality is often more
            nuanced. Many doors labeled as “wood” actually consist of several components:</p>

        <p><b>Wood Frame:</b> The core structure is typically made of a sturdy wood frame, often pine or fir.</p>

        <p><b>Veneer:</b> Thin slices of desirable wood (like oak, mahogany, or cherry) are glued to the frame, creating
            a visible surface.</p>

        <p><b>Core Fillers:</b> The spaces within the frame are often filled with materials like:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Particleboard:</b> Made from compressed wood chips.</li>
                    <li><b>Honeycomb:</b> A lightweight, rigid material made from paper.</li>
                    <li><b>Solid Wood:</b> Some doors use solid wood fillers for increased durability.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jan-Blog-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""
                1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h3>Why This Construction?</h3>

        <p><b>Cost-Effectiveness:</b> Solid wood doors can be very expensive. This construction method offers a more
            budget-friendly alternative while still providing the look of a high-end wood door.</p>

        <p><b>Stability:</b> Wood can expand and contract with changes in humidity. This construction helps minimize
            warping and cracking. The interior wood frame is constructed using a ‘grain against grain’ method. This
            means that the wood pieces are arranged so that the wood grain alternates in direction with each piece. This
            ensures that if the wood expands or contracts within the frame due to weather factors (like moisture from
            humidity), the door will remain stable and not experience a high degree of warping.</p>

        <p><b>Improved Insulation:</b> The fillers provide better insulation compared to a solid wood core. Homeowners
            should note, though, that a front door built from fiberglass or aluminum will typically have better energy
            efficiency than even an engineered wood front door.</p>

        <h3>What to Look For:</h3>

        <p>When choosing a “wood door,” consider these factors:</p>

        <p><b>Veneer Quality:</b> The thickness and quality of the veneer significantly impact the door’s appearance and
            durability.</p>

        <p><b>Core Material:</b> Understand what’s filling the door’s interior. Solid wood cores are generally the most
            durable but also the most expensive.</p>

        <p><b>Construction:</b> Look for well-made doors with securely attached veneer and a sturdy frame.</p>

        <h3>Cost and Maintenance</h3>

        <p>It’s true that a wood front door will give your Raleigh, NC home charming curb appeal. However, it’s
            important to note that a wood front door is often more costly than a door made from fiberglass, aluminum, or
            other composite material.</p>

        <p>It’s also true that even engineered wood doors require a higher degree of maintenance and are more prone to
            rot and warp than doors made from other materials.</p>

        <p>This is why many homeowners opt for fiberglass or aluminum doors that mimic the look of wood. Many of these
            doors can even be stained, making it almost impossible to tell that they aren’t true wood doors.</p>

        <h3>In Conclusion:</h3>

        <p>While the term “wood door” might not always mean a door made entirely of solid wood, it still offers a
            beautiful and durable option for your home. By understanding the construction methods, you can make an
            informed decision that best suits your needs and budget.</p>

        "<p>Homeowners are often confused when they visit our<a href="" /windows""> Raleigh, NC window supply store</a>
            and hear us talking about their windows. They know that their window is 2 feet four inches wide by three and
            a half feet tall. So, why are we referring to it as a “Two-Four-Three-Six”?</p>

        <p>In this post, we’ll explain how windows are measured and the shorthand used for window sizes. We’ll also
            explain why the size of your window should not match the size of the opening where the window will be
            placed.</p>

        <p>At the end of the post, you’ll also find a handy one page printable reference sheet of some standard window
            sizes and their shorthand labels.</p>

                homeowner measures a window captioned with "" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h3>How A Four Digit Code Translates to Window Sizes:</h3>

        <p>Most window manufacturers use a simple four-digit code to represent window size. This code might seem like
            gibberish at first, but it’s actually quite straightforward. Here’s the breakdown:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The first two digits:</strong> Represent the window’s width in feet and inches. For example,
                “24” would indicate a width of 2 feet 4 inches.</li>
            <li><strong>The last two digits:</strong> Represent the window’s height in feet and inches. Continuing our
                example, “36” would signify a height of 3 feet 6 inches.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So, a window labeled “2436” translates to 2 feet 4 inches wide by 3 feet 6 inches tall. These numbers are
            said as individual digits, so, “Two-Four-Three-Six” and not “Twenty-four, thirty-six”.</p>

        <h3>Rough Opening vs. Actual Size:</h3>

        <p>It’s important to distinguish between the window’s <strong>rough opening size</strong> (the space in your
            wall where the window will be installed) and the <strong>actual window size</strong>. The rough opening is
            typically about 1/2 inch smaller than the actual window to allow for proper installation and movement.</p>

        <h3>Standard Sizes:</h3>

        <p>Window manufacturers offer a range of standard sizes to cater to most common needs. These sizes typically
            vary in 2-inch increments for width and 4-inch increments for height.</p>

        <p>Understanding this can result in big savings for thrifty homeowners. We sometimes see remodelers and
            architects recommending custom window sizes for home improvement projects. Often, by swapping these custom
            sizes for the closest standard size, we are able to save homeowners a significant amount of money off the
            bottom line of their window replacement.</p>

        <p>Here’s a handy one-page printable guide with references to some of the most common window sizes, as well as
            their four-digit labels.</p>

        <p>One common question that we are asked by visitors in our <a href="" /windows"">Cary, NC window showroom</a>

                height="" 1500""></p>

        <p>Depending on a variety of factors, windows may need to be installed from inside or outside of a building.</p>

        <h2>New Construction Windows Can be Installed from Inside or Outside of a Home</h2>

        <p>For new construction, installation may occur from either inside or outside of the structure. Ultimately, it
            will depend on the framing used and the preference of the installer.</p>

        <p>For instance, a third-story window may be safer to install from inside versus working on a ladder from
            outside.</p>

        <h2>Pocket Replacement Windows May be Installed from Inside or Outside a Home</h2>

        <p>Whether they are vinyl, wood, aluminum or fiberglass clad, pocked replacement windows may be installed from
            inside or outside a home. Again, this depends on the installer’s preference based on the unique features of
            the construction of the home and the window’s specifications.</p>

        <h2>Full Frame Replacement Windows Must Be Installed from Outside of a Home</h2>

        <p>Full Frame replacement windows must be installed from the outside of a home so that they can be affixed to
            the outside sheathing (the house’s wood frame).</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Pro Tip: Some homeowners think they’re saving time by bringing full frame replacement windows into the
                room they’ll be installed in prior to installation. But, this just means spending more time returning
                the windows outside, since that’s where they’ll be installed from. That’s why we recommend storing these
                windows in a garage or other protected area with easy outdoor access.</p>

        "<p>If you are considering replacing your home’s window, or if you’re building a new home, you may be wondering
            how to choose the right size window for your space. Here is the foolproof, five-step process that we
            recommend to homeowners who visit our <a href="" /windows"">Morrisville, NC area window installation
                store</a>.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pinterest-right-size-window.jpg"" alt=""
                Four seasons room with large windows captioned with "" avoid costly design mistakes: five steps to
                choosing the right size window for your space"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>1. Consider the Size of the Room PLUS Your Home’s Style</h2>

        <p>As a general rule, the larger the room the larger the windows can be. However, there is no prescriptive rule
            for how much of a wall should be taken up by windows; anything from 0-100% can be correct.</p>

        <p>That’s because, in addition to the size of the room, you’ll also need to consider the architectural style of
            your home when you try to identify the right size window for your space. A modern home can look spectacular
            with floor-to-ceiling windows. However, this same design choice would look bizarre on a traditional colonial
            brick home.</p>

        <p>What we don’t recommend is trying to make a very small room appear larger by adding a relatively oversized
            window.</p>

        <p>Here, for example, the large window only highlights how cramped this room is.</p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/5-reasons-to-love-floor-to-ceiling-slim-vertical-windows/"">This
                small room is a perfect example of one that might look spectacular with a slim, vertical window</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. Think about the Function of the Room</h2>

        <p>If your kitchen has a great view of your backyard, and you like the idea of being able to see your
            landscaping and watching kids and pets play, you may want a large window in that space.</p>

        <p>If, however, you are looking for a window for your home office, and you know that you’d be easily distracted
            by beautiful or busy views, you may want to opt for a smaller window.</p>

        <p>Overall, modern windows will be quieter than older, wood or vinyl windows. However, the larger the window,
            the more potential there is for sound to infiltrate. Be sure to consider how sound may affect how your
            spaces function.</p>

        <h2>3. Consider the Light you Want in the Room</h2>

        <p>A primary factor in the light you’ll get in a room is the direction that the wall is facing.</p>

        <p><strong>South-Facing Rooms:</strong> These rooms receive direct sunlight for most of the day. Smaller windows
            can help manage heat gain and prevent glare. Consider also using blinds or curtains to control the amount of
            light.</p>

        <p><strong>North-Facing Rooms:</strong> North-facing rooms receive indirect sunlight, which is generally softer
            and more consistent. Larger windows can help maximize natural light in these spaces.</p>

        <p><strong>East-Facing Rooms:</strong> These rooms receive morning sunlight, which can be bright and
            invigorating. Consider smaller windows to avoid excessive heat gain during the summer.</p>

        <p><strong>West-Facing Rooms:</strong> West-facing rooms receive afternoon and evening sunlight, which can be
            intense. Opt for smaller windows or use blinds to control the amount of light and heat.</p>

        <h2>4. Determine the Mood you want in the Room</h2>

        <p>The perfect size window will accentuate the feel you’re hoping to achieve in a room. For instance:</p>

        <p><strong>Bright and Airy:</strong> For a cheerful and open feel, choose larger windows that allow for plenty
            of natural light.</p>

        <p><strong>Cozy and Intimate:</strong> Smaller windows can create a more intimate and cozier atmosphere.
            Consider using curtains or blinds to create an additional sense of warmth.</p>

        <p><strong>Dramatic and Moody:</strong> For a dramatic and moody ambiance, opt for fewer, larger windows that
            allow for dramatic lighting effects.</p>

        <h2>5. Confirm that your Dream Window can be Built</h2>

        <p>We recently worked with a customer who wanted to replace a window with a larger, vinyl window. The dimensions
            he wanted were roughly 70” X 90”.</p>

        <p>Although we were able to quote and order the window, we soon got a call from the production factory with some
            bad news.</p>

        <p>They found that the window was so large that the vinyl frame could not support the weight of the large piece
            of glass.</p>

        <p>In short, they could not make the window with reasonable expectations that it would function properly. They
            quickly updated their ordering software so that no one else would face the same disappointment!</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, composite and aluminum-clad windows can be built to larger sizes than vinyl windows can
            be. However, it’s important to note that all windows have maximum sizes, above which they can’t be built.

        "<p><a href="" /windows"">Our window replacement store is located just outside of Raleigh, in central North
                Carolina</a>. We are frequently asked “Should I get impact-resistant windows for my home in the
            Triangle?”</p>

        <p>In this post, we’ll explain what impact-resistant windows (aka Hurricane Windows) are, and why we don’t
            typically recommend them for homes in the Raleigh area.</p>

        <h2>What are Impact-Resistant Windows?</h2>

        <p>An impact-resistant window is a type of window designed to withstand strong winds, hail, and debris impact.
            They are particularly important for homes in areas prone to hurricanes, tornadoes, or other severe weather
            events.</p>

        <h3>Alternative Names for Impact-Resistant Windows</h3>

        <p>These windows have a few other common names you might encounter:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hurricane windows</li>
            <li>Coastal windows</li>
            <li>Impact windows</li>
            <li>Laminated glass windows</li>
            <li>High-impact windows</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whatever you call them, here’s what makes them impact-resistant:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Laminated glass:</strong> Impact-resistant windows use laminated glass, which is two or more
                panes of glass bonded together with a strong plastic interlayer. This interlayer holds the glass
                together even if it breaks, preventing shattering and creating a barrier against wind and debris.</li>
            <li><strong>Thicker glass:</strong> Compared to a standard window, these windows often use thicker glass
                panes for increased strength.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>This Makes Impact-Resistant Windows Heavier than Typical Windows:</h2>

        <p>Due to the use of laminated glass and thicker panes, impact-resistant windows are considerably heavier than
            standard windows. This extra weight can impact several aspects:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Installation:</strong> Impact-resistant windows may require additional support during
                installation due to the weight. Reinforced window frames are often used to handle the additional stress.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Operation:</strong> Because of the weight, these windows may require stronger operating
                mechanisms to open and close easily. This is especially true for larger windows.</li>
            <li><strong>Structural considerations:</strong> In extreme cases, especially for large windows or
                multi-story applications, the increased weight of impact-resistant windows may require structural
                reinforcement in the walls to support them. In homes with oversized windows, we generally recommend
                working with a structural engineer, to ensure that the home’s foundation can support the additional
                load; These windows are THAT heavy!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Increased Cost</h2>

        <p>With all of these additional factors making a window impact-resistant, it may not surprise you to learn that
            these windows are typically much costlier than their non-impact resistant counterpart.</p>

        <p>It’s not uncommon for <strong>hurricane windows to cost twice as much as standard residential
                windows</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Engineered for Hurricanes</h2>

        <p>Standard windows are designed to endure even above average high wind forces.</p>

        <p>Impact-resistant windows, on the other hand, are built for the brutality of hurricanes. The interlayer we
            described above prevents windows from shattering, even if struck with heavy flying objects.</p>

        <p>As Andersen Windows explains in this video, the purpose of this is not just to prevent injury from broken
            glass. The true purpose is to prevent wind energy from building up inside your home, as this can cause
            devastating damage. This video also shows how Andersen tests its coastal glass with impressive force
            testing.</p>

        <h2>Are Impact-Resistant Windows More Secure Than Regular Windows?</h2>

        <p>One common myth about hurricane windows is that they offer more security from home break-ins than standard
            windows do.</p>

        <p>It’s important to keep in mind two facts when considering whether this is true.</p>

        <h3>1. Most Home Break-in’s are Not of the ‘Smash-and-Grab’ Variety</h3>

        <p>In fact, according to<a href="" https://www.adt.com/resources/how-do-burglars-break-into-houses""> home
                security company ADT, over 50% of home intruders simply enter homes through an unlocked front or back
                door.</a> When it comes to windows, again, intruders are much more likely to open an unlocked window
            than they are to break a window and risk the noise alerting someone to their presence.</p>

        <p>Given these two facts, we generally recommend that homeowners not consider hurricane windows if their only
            motivation is home security. The additional cost and engineering considerations generally outweigh the
            almost non-existent security benefit that hurricane windows provide.</p>

        <h3>2. That Being Said, “Hurricane-Proof” ≠ “People Proof”</h3>

        <p>The features that make a door hurricane-resistant are not the same as features that would make a window
            impervious to burglars. Even impact-resistant windows can be broken into.</p>

        <p>While many people believe that impact-resistant windows offer more home security, this is unfortunately
            usually something they have been told by a sales associate trying to take advantage of their fear and upsell
            them on a window they don’t need.</p>

        <p>For most homeowners, they don’t provide substantial enough safety benefits to justify the increased cost.
            That’s why we don’t recommend hurricane windows unless a homeowner lives in an area where they are justified
            (or required) because of the weather.</p>

        <h2>So, Should You Get Impact-Resistant Windows?</h2>

        <p>Certainly, if you live in a location where local building codes require impact-resistant windows, then you
            must have them.</p>

        <p>But, here in central North Carolina, impact-resistant windows are probably not necessary.</p>

        <p>Especially when you consider the additional cost and installation/construction challenges that come with
            them, you would likely be better off with standard windows.</p>

        <p>The tempered glass in them is sufficient for most weather events. And simply locking whatever windows you
            choose (along with your doors) is probably sufficient to avoid home break-in’s.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>When it’s time to choose new windows, you want to talk with professionals who can help you understand the
            options available. That way, you can be sure that you’re making the right choice for your home, your family,
            and your budget.</p>

        "<p>Your front door is more than just an entry point; it’s the guardian of your home, providing security and a
            welcoming first impression. But like any hardworking element of your house, it won’t last forever. So, how
            long should a front door last?</p>

        <p>This is a common question we are asked by homeowners who stop by our <a href="" /doors"">Cary, NC door sales
                depot</a>.</p>

        <p>The answer depends on three key factors: material, weather, and maintenance. Let’s explore how different
            materials weather the elements (pun intended!), and what you can do to keep your door performing its best
            for years to come.</p>

                How Long should a front door last?"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>How Long a Front Door Should Last Depends on What it’s Made of</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Fiberglass Doors:</strong> Offering a balance of beauty and brawn, fiberglass doors can hold
                    their own for <strong>up to 70 years</strong>. They can mimic the look of wood but stand strong
                    against moisture, warping, and heat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Wood Doors:</strong> The classic choice, wood doors exude elegance but require more TLC.
                    Depending on the wood type, they can last <strong>20 to 40 years</strong>. However, they’re
                    susceptible to warping, rot, and insect damage in extreme weather conditions. The sun is also
                    tremendously damaging to wood doors (see below).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Weather Affects Your Front Door’s Longevity</h2>

        <p>The climate can take a toll on doors. Here’s how:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Temperature Swings:</strong> Extreme heat can cause wood doors to warp and crack, while cold
                    temperatures can make them brittle. Here in central North Carolina, we can experience both extremes
                    in a relatively short period of time, which can be especially rough on front doors. Fiberglass doors
                    handle temperature fluctuations better than wood. That’s because Fiberglass doors are less likely to
                    expand and contract in temperature swings than wood doors are.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Humidity:</strong> High humidity is particularly damaging to wood doors, as it promotes rot
                    and mildew growth. Fiberglass doors are less affected.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Over time, wood doors exposed to direct sunlight will typically dry out, and
                may then crack and warp. They will also almost certainly fade from continual sun exposure. By contrast,
                fiberglass doors are generally unaffected by sun exposure.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It’s important to note that there are some things you can do to protect your front door from the elements.
            Using shade trees or an awning or overhang to protect your door from direct sunlight, especially if it’s a
            wood door, can help extend the life of your door.</p>

        <h2>What You Should Do to Make Your Front Door Last as Long As Possible</h2>

        <p>No matter the material your front door is made from, some TLC goes a long way:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Regular Cleaning:</strong> Wipe down your door with a damp cloth and a mild cleaning solution
                    to remove dirt, dust, and cobwebs. This helps prevent the buildup of grime, which can damage the
                    finish.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Seasonal Maintenance:</strong> For wood doors, inspect for cracks and warping annually. Apply
                    a fresh coat of sealant or paint every few years to protect the wood from moisture damage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Weatherstripping Check:</strong> Weatherstripping creates a tight seal around the door,
                    preventing drafts and leaks. Inspect it for wear and tear, and replace it if necessary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Hardware Maintenance:</strong> Keep hinges lubricated and tighten loose screws to ensure
                    smooth operation and prevent misalignment.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        "<p>Some homeowners who visit our <a href="" /doors"">Cary, NC door supply store</a> ask if they should replace
            a whole door, or just the slab (the flat panel of a door).</p>

        <p>In this article, we’ll explain the differences between a door slab and a pre-hung door. We’ll also share 5
            reasons why a pre-hung door is the right choice almost every time.</p>

        <h3>What’s the Difference Between a Door Slab and a Pre-Hung Door?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Door Slab:</strong> This is just the flat panel, the most recognizable part of the door that
                    swings open and shut. It doesn’t come with any additional components. Imagine it as a standalone
                    piece of wood. You’ll need to purchase the frame, hinges, and hardware separately to make it a
                    functional door.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Pre-Hung Door:</strong> This is the all-in-one package. It includes the door slab already
                    attached to a hinged frame, ready to be installed in your doorway. Some pre-hung doors may even come
                    pre-drilled for the doorknob and deadbolt, making installation quicker and more accurate.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here’s a table summarizing the key differences:</p>

        <h2>5 Reasons Why a Pre-Hung Door is Better Than a Slab Every Time</h2>

        <h3>1. Faster and Easier Installation</h3>

        <p>Swapping a slab requires mortising hinges and installing the hardware yourself.</p>

        <p>Pre-hung doors come ready-made, significantly reducing installation time and complexity. This is especially
            true for DIYers – you’ll save yourself the hassle of precise measurements and potential carpentry mishaps.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Guaranteed Fit and Alignment</h3>

        <p>A pre-hung door is a complete unit, ensuring a perfect fit between the door and frame. No more worries about
            gaps, uneven hinges, or a door that scrapes the floor.</p>

        <p>With a slab, even a slight miscalculation during installation can lead to a frustrating outcome.</p>

        <h3>3. Like-New Look for the Entire Doorway</h3>

        <p>Replacing just the slab leaves the old frame in place. This frame might be worn, chipped, or painted a
            mismatched color.</p>

        <p>A pre-hung door refreshes the entire doorway, giving your home a more polished look.</p>

        <h3>4. Improved Weatherproofing for Exterior Doors</h3>

        <p>For exterior doors, a pre-hung unit ensures a proper seal around the entire door. This pre-assembled
            weatherproofing helps keep out drafts and moisture, improving energy efficiency and overall comfort in your
            home.</p>

        <h3>5. Increased Security</h3>

        <p>A pre-hung door and frame are manufactured and assembled together as a unit. This ensures a tight fit and
            proper alignment of all components, including the pre-drilled holes for hinges and locksets. This tight fit
            makes it harder to pry open the door or force entry.</p>

        <p>By contrast, when replacing just the slab, you’re using the existing frame. Over time, the frame can become
            warped, cracked, or loose, creating weak points that could be exploited during a break-in. Additionally,
            improperly aligning the slab with the frame during installation can leave gaps that compromise security.</p>

        <h2>Expert Door Installers in Cary, NC</h2>

        <p>These are just some of the many reasons why we almost always advise homeowners that a pre-hung door is better
            than a slab.</p>

        "<p>When designing your home’s interior, countless details come into play, and doors are a surprisingly
            impactful element.</p>

        <p>You might be wondering: should the door heights throughout my home match, and should the interior doors be
            the same height as the exterior doors? This is a common question that homeowners ask when they visit our <a
                href="" /doors"">Raleigh, NC door showroom</a>.</p>

        <p>The answer, like many things in design, depends on the aesthetic you’re aiming for!</p>

        <p>Let’s delve into some popular architectural styles and how each style handles this question.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pinterest-door-height.jpg"" alt=""

        <h2>Classic Continuity: Matching Heights for Timeless Appeal</h2>

        <p><img src=""

                1920"" height="" 1274""></p>

        <p><strong>Styles: Colonial, Georgian, Traditional</strong></p>

        <p>Picture a charming New England colonial or a stately Georgian manor.</p>

        <p>In these styles, balance, symmetry, and proportion reign supreme. Matching the interior door height to the
            exterior door (typically 6’8″ or 8’0″) creates a cohesive flow throughout the house.</p>

        <h2>Grand Entrances: Making a Statement with Taller Exterior Doors</h2>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Springline_Entranceway_5369.jpg"" alt=""

        <p><strong>Styles: French Countryside, Mediterranean Villas, and Victorian Estates</strong></p>

        <p>Imagine a sprawling French chateau or a sun-drenched Mediterranean villa.</p>

        <p>Here, a grand entrance is key.</p>

        <p>The exterior door can be a showstopper, towering over the standard interior door height. A visually stunning,
            oversize front door makes crossing the threshold into the home an unforgettable welcome.</p>

        <h2>Modern Mix: Experimenting with Proportion</h2>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mod-home-.jpg"" alt="" modern
                architecture home with asymmetrical roof at dusk"" width="" 1000"" height="" 600"">Styles: Mid-Century
            Modern and Minimalist Abodes</p>

        <p>Clean lines and a focus on function define these styles.</p>

        <p>You might see a standard 6’8″ interior door height paired with a sleek, slightly taller exterior door. Here,
            the emphasis is on creating a streamlined look, not necessarily replicating the exterior height throughout.
            Smaller finishes, such as consistent door hardware and a neutral color palette, will be more key to
            achieving the look than whether the front door is slightly taller than the interior doors.</p>

        <h2>Adding Character: Deliberate Mismatches for a Unique Touch</h2>

        <p><strong><img src=""

            heights can add to the vintage, lived-in feel.</p>

        <p>Pantries, bathrooms, and closets are popular rooms for homeowners to experiment with smaller door heights,
            while doors leading to bedrooms, offices, and other key spaces may be oversized.</p>

        <h2>Key Considerations:</h2>

        <p>As you consider whether the door heights throughout your home should match, take your ceiling heights into
            consideration. Know that you can definitely change the feel of a space with different size doors. Taller
            doors can make rooms with low ceilings feel cramped, while shorter doors might get lost in a lofty space.
        </p>

        <p>Of course, you must consider your family’s needs. If you have tall family members, standard-height doors
            might feel restrictive.</p>

        <p>Lastly, it’s important to consider cost. Taller doors and custom modifications generally come with a higher
            price tag.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the decision of whether to have uniform door heights and whether to match the exterior door is
            yours.</p>

        <p>By understanding the design principles behind different architectural styles, you can choose an approach that
            reflects your personal taste and creates a cohesive, beautiful home.</p>

                reasons to love ProVia doors"" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>Who is ProVia</h2>

        <p>Ohio-based ProVia is a leading manufacturer of windows, doors, vinyl siding, and manufactured stone.</p>

        <p>Founded in 1977, the company has developed a reputation for offering high-quality products, a wide array of
            customization options, and a commitment to energy efficiency.</p>

        <p>They have been awarded the ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year Award several times, and they have also been
            recognized by J.D. Power for their customer satisfaction ratings.</p>

        <h2>What Sets ProVia Doors Apart</h2>

        <p>If you search online for reviews of ProVia doors, you’ll find lots of feedback about the wide array of
            customization options available.</p>

        <p>You’ll also see lots of praise for the sturdy materials used in ProVia’s doors.</p>

        <p>While we certainly agree with these reviewers, and appreciate these aspects of ProVia’s door line, we wanted
            to share a more detailed review based on factors that the average homeowners may not recognize.</p>

        <p>We believe that ProVia’s true quality is in these small but critical details, and this is what sets them
            apart from the majority of other door manufacturers.</p>

        <h2>1. Factory Built Doors</h2>

        <p>Many doors are produced as a series of parts and pieces by the manufacturer. These parts and pieces are then
            sent to a distributor, whose teams assemble the doors and prepare them for shipping.</p>

        <p>Though this is the industry standard, you can probably imagine that this process results in some loss and
            damage along the way. That means that homeowners may receive damaged materials or be missing critical parts
            when they go install their new front door.</p>

        <p>ProVia makes their doors differently. Each ProVia door is fully built by the ProVia team at their factory.
            This makes for a tight quality control, consistent manufacturing process.</p>

        <p>The doors are heavily engineered in a good way, and with a goal of easing installation. This includes a
            self-leveling system, marks for screws, and a built in process to hide screws after installation.</p>

        <p>This makes ProVia doors the easiest in the industry to install, and some of the best looking once installed.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Excellent Shipping Standards</h2>

        <p>Because their doors are built exclusively in-house, ProVia manages their own logistics. They ship their own
            products in a company owned fleet driven by employees who work for ProVia.  This ensures care, consistency,
            and accountability throughout the shipping process.</p>

        <p>But, what impresses us most about their logistics operation is the extreme care that ProVia takes in
            packaging their doors.</p>

        <p>This is how most doors arrive at our warehouse. You can see that much of the door is exposed. You can
            probably imagine that a door transported in this condition may arrive scratched, dented, or otherwise
            damaged (and you’d be right).</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/standard-door-shipping.jpg"" alt=""
                Doors packaged for shipping "" width="" 287"" height="" 653""></p>

        <p>By contrast, this is how ProVia doors arrive. The door is completely boxed and braced.</p>

        <p>Of course there are no guarantees, but this shipping standard does wonders to reduce materials arriving
            damaged or with missing parts and pieces.</p>

        <h2>3. Best-in-Industry Warranty</h2>

        <p><a href="" https://entrylink.provia.com/entrylink/doc.aspx?id=1066"">We’ve never seen a door warranty as
                comprehensive as ProVia’s</a>.*</p>

        <p>Their entry doors are generally covered by a lifetime warranty that is transferable should you sell your home
            (or purchase a new home with a ProVia entry door).</p>

        <p>There’s also a 20-year-warranty against seal failure for doors containing glass; this is unheard of in the
            door industry!</p>

        <p><em>*You should always confirm the details of your own door warranty.</em></p>

        <h2>A Door Expert’s Honest Review of ProVia Doors</h2>

        <p>ProVia doors are exceptionally well-made. They meet the most stringent energy efficiency standards, and are
            designed to last.</p>

        <p>The care that the company takes during manufacturing and shipping is what sets them apart from other
            companies in the industry.</p>

        <p>We don’t worry about a ProVia door arriving damaged or incorrectly built. It simply doesn’t happen.</p>

        <p>What does happen is that our customers and our installation team alike continue to be impressed by the
            quality of ProVia doors.</p>

        <p>This level of quality and craftsmanship does come at moderately premium price. However, we can’t argue that
            the price is very fair for the quality you get in a ProVia door.</p>

        <p>We’ve started making the analogy that choosing a ProVia door is like buying a meal at Chick-Fil-A.</p>

        <p>You won’t be getting the cheapest meal in town; if you’re looking for the least expensive lunch off the
            ‘dollar special menu’, you’ll need to look elsewhere.</p>

        <p>But, if you’re willing to spend a bit more for a well-made, reliable product delivered with excellent
            customer service, you’ll find it in a ProVia door.</p>

        "<p>Living in Raleigh, North Carolina, you know the importance of a <a href="" /doors"">strong, stylish front
                door</a>. It not only welcomes guests but also protects your home from the elements – the scorching
            summer sun and the occasional hurricane breeze.</p>

        <p>So, what’s the best front door material for homes in Raleigh, NC?</p>

        <p>Here’s a breakdown of the three most popular contenders to help you pick what’s best for your home and your
            family.</p>

        <h3>Is a Wood Front Door the Best for Homes in Raleigh, NC?</h3>

        <p><strong>• Pros:</strong> Wood doors exude timeless elegance and can be stained or painted to match any
            architectural style. They offer excellent insulation, keeping your home cool in the summer and warm in the
            winter.</p>

        <p><strong>• Cons:</strong> Wood requires regular maintenance – staining or painting every few years – to
            withstand Raleigh’s weather. It’s also more susceptible to warping, rotting, and insect damage. Wood doors
            tend to be the most expensive option. It’s also important to consider that many wood door’s warranties are
            voided if they aren’t installed under an overhang to prevent sun damage.</p>

        <h3>Is an Aluminum Front Door the Best for Homes in Raleigh, NC?</h3>

        <p><strong>• Pros:</strong> Aluminum doors are champions of affordability and low maintenance. They’re resistant
            to rust, rot, and warping, making them ideal for Raleigh’s humid climate. They’re also lightweight, making
            them easier to handle during installation.</p>

        <p><strong>• Cons:</strong> Aluminum offers minimal insulation, which can translate to higher energy bills. It
            also dents easily and can feel flimsy compared to other materials. The lack of design flexibility might not
            suit all architectural styles.</p>

        <h3>Is a Fiberglass (or Fiberglass Composite) the Best for Homes in Raleigh, NC?</h3>

        <p><strong>• Pros:</strong> Fiberglass doors offer the best of both worlds: the beauty of wood with the
            durability of aluminum. They come pre-finished in a variety of wood-grain styles that require minimal
            maintenance. Fiberglass offers excellent insulation and resists warping, rot, and insect damage.</p>

        <p><strong>• Cons:</strong> While less expensive than wood, fiberglass doors are generally pricier than
            aluminum.
            Choosing Your Raleigh Right</p>

        <p>While every family and home is unique, most of our customers settle on a fiberglass composite door. These
            doors offer excellent energy efficiency, require minimal maintenance, and are extremely durable. They can
            stand up to the intense weather that the Raleigh, NC area experiences.</p>

        "<p>Sometimes, visitors to our <a href="" /windows"">Cary, NC window showroom</a> will ask about storm windows.
        </p>

        <p>For many folks, especially those who grew up in older homes, storm windows are a familiar sight. These extra
            panes of glass, mounted on the exterior or interior of primary windows, were once a common way to boost a
            home’s energy efficiency.</p>

        <p>But with advancements in window technology, storm windows have seen a decline in popularity. Let’s delve into
            what storm windows are and explore some modern alternatives that have all but made them obsolete.</p>

                for Storm Windows? Here's why you can't find them"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>What are Storm Windows?</h2>

        <p>Storm windows are separate, often removable, panels that attach to your existing windows.</p>

        <p>Traditionally made of aluminum and glass, they create an additional layer of insulation, reducing drafts and
            heat transfer.</p>

        <p>The key benefit of storm windows is that they keep your home warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer,
            leading to lower energy bills.</p>

        <h2>Why the Decline?</h2>

        <p>While storm windows offered a cost-effective way to improve home insulation in the past, modern windows have
            made them somewhat obsolete.</p>

        <p>Here’s why:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vinyl and Fiberglass Composite Windows are a better alternative:</strong>With the introduction
                of vinyl windows in the 1950’s and fiberglass composite windows in the 1970’s, homeowners had
                alternatives to storm windows that were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Less expensive</li>
                    <li>Easier to install</li>
                    <li>More energy efficient</li>
                    <li>Less of a maintenance hassle</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Double or Triple-Pane Windows:</strong>Today’s standard windows are typically double or
                triple-paned, with two or three layers of glass separated by an insulating gas like argon. This built-in
                insulation provides similar benefits to storm windows without the need for an additional installation.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Installation and Maintenance:</strong>Storm windows require installation and removal, which can
                be time-consuming. They also add another layer of glass to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-E Coatings:</strong>Many modern windows come with a low-emissivity (low-E) coating. This
                invisible layer reflects thermal radiation, further enhancing a window’s insulating properties.
                <blockquote>

                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Alternatives to Storm Windows</h2>

        <p>If you’re looking to improve your home’s energy efficiency, here are some modern alternatives to storm
            windows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Window Replacement:</strong> Replacing older, single-pane windows with double or triple-pane,
                    low-E windows (either vinyl or fiberglass composite) offers significant energy savings and improved
                    comfort.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Window Inserts:</strong> Pocket insert replacements keep the existing window frame while
                    replacing the sash and glass. They offer a more discreet approach to adding insulation and can be a
                    good option for historic homes where preserving the original windows is important.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Weather Sealing:</strong> Drafty windows can often be improved by replacing weatherstripping
                    and re-caulking around the frame. This simple and affordable fix can significantly reduce air leaks.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>As <a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/why-are-windows-so-expensive/"">we outline in detail in this
                article, windows are generally made to order</a>. For this reason, manufacturers don’t typically accept

            make no guarantees that this advice will be applicable or helpful to you.</h3>

        <h2>1. Use Facebook Marketplace</h2>

        <p>We have tried reselling windows online through a variety of platforms: Craigslist, local construction groups,
            etc. In our experience, the most hassle free and reliable way to sell windows online is through the <a

            <li>Warranty still in effect</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Take Great Pictures</h2>

        <p>We recommend taking pictures showing both interior and exterior sides of the window (especially if they are
            different colors). If the window is new and still has stickers/tags on it, detailed pictures of these are
            good to include as well.</p>

        <p>Finally, if your <a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/do-i-have-andersen-windows-how-to-find-out-in-under-a-minute/"">window has
                an etching in the glass to indicate the manufacturer</a>, we recommend taking a close-up photo of this
            as well.</p>

        <h2>3. Expect Scammers</h2>

        <p>It’s not a question of if you will be contacted by scammers when you try to resell windows online; it’s a
            question of when.</p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.facebook.com/help/1674717642789671"">Facebook maintains information about common scam
                tactics</a>, and this can be a helpful resource to check to confirm that you’re doing communicating with
            someone who legitimately wants to buy your window.</p>

        <p>The most common scam we’ve seen is people offering to wire transfer money in exchange for us shipping
            windows.</p>

        <p>Consider that the cost of shipping a window is quite high, and would cancel out any savings the buyer might
            gain from buying a second-hand window.</p>

        <p>This is your first clue that the person is not a genuine potential buyer.</p>

        <p>This is also why we recommend you limit your sale to local pick up only.</p>

        <p>These have been the Top 3 questions that potential buyers ask us:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>What else do you have for sale?</strong> Oftentimes people looking to DIY home projects are
                hopeful to collect lots of materials at once. This is not necessarily a sign of a scammer.</li>
            <li><strong>What size are the windows, what color are they, which way do they open?</strong> We know that if
                you’ve followed our template, you’ve already provided all of this information. But it never fails that
                potential buyers will want to double check certain details.</li>
            <li><strong>Will You Deliver?</strong> Again, even if you’ve specified local pick up, it’s common for folks
                to ask if you’ll deliver. This is obviously up to you, just keep in mind that windows can be very
                difficult to load and transport. Be sure that the window/s is/are well protected, and don’t be shy about
                asking for an additional delivery fee. We know firsthand that moving windows is tough business!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>5. Know That Bigger or More Custom Windows Can be Harder to Sell</h2>

        <p>There are usually plenty of folks looking for white-white double hung windows 2 ft x 4ft.</p>

        <p>But if you’re trying to unload a bronze exterior 4 ft X 5ft picture window? You may have a wait a bit to find
            someone who’s interested.</p>

        <p>This doesn’t mean your window won’t ever sell. It just may mean that you’ll need to renew your listing
            periodically until you find someone who is looking for this exact window.</p>

        <p>In listings like these, it can help to add a few adjectives. So, instead of just listing the unit size,
            include a word like “Big”, “Large”, or “Oversize”. This may help people find your window when they are
            searching marketplace.</p>

        <p>Likewise, include both the shape name (“Trapezoid”) and a descriptor such as “Unique shape” if you have a
            window that’s not a rectangle or square shape.</p>

        <p>Write both a general color description (“black”) and the manufacturer’s color name “Cocoa Bean” instead of
            simply describing the window as  black.</p>

        <h2>6. Store Windows Properly While Waiting for a Sale</h2>

        <p>Keep windows out of the elements while waiting for them to sell.</p>

        <p>While installed windows are certainly weatherproof, windows with exposed sides will be damaged if left in the
            elements. Keep them safe indoors or in a watertight garage or shed.</p>

        <h2>7. When it’s Time to Sell Your Windows, Think Safety</h2>

        <p>Again, <a href="" https://www.facebook.com/help/728437264275111"">Facebook shares some tips related to safety
                when meeting someone from Facebook Marketplace</a>.</p>

        <p>Unless you have agreed to deliver windows, it’s likely that the person buying your window/s will be coming to
            your home. If possible, have multiple people at home and meet where a security doorbell can record the
            meeting.</p>

        <h2>8. How to Set A Price When You’re Reselling Windows Online</h2>

        <p>As a general rule, we recommend listing a window you’re reselling online for 70% of the value of a window.
        </p>

        <p>You should be ready to negotiate, and willing to accept as low as 50% of the value of the window.</p>

        <h2>9. Seek Legal Advice if Relevant</h2>

        <p>Unfortunately, we often share this advice with homeowners whose construction projects have not gone to plan.
        </p>

        <p>This may be because of a dispute with the contractor who was hired to install windows.</p>

        <p>If you have any ongoing legal claims that involve the windows in question, seek legal advice to confirm that
            it is OK for you to sell the windows prior to the dispute being resolved.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>Of course, the best advice we have for not having to resell windows online is to make sure that your window
            order is correct in the first place. When it’s time to replace your home’s windows, you want to work with
            professionals who can help you avoid costly mistakes.</p>

        <p>At Window Works Co., we’ve helped thousands of Apex homeowners find the windows they’ve loved.</p>

        "<p>Window grilles can add a touch of architectural interest to your home. But choosing the wrong grille type or
            installation can leave your windows looking awkward, and can detract from your home’s curb appeal.</p>

        <p>We tell homeowners who visit our <a href="" /windows"">Cary, NC window replacement company</a> to avoid these
            three grille mistakes when updating a home’s windows.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/pinterest-grille-mistakes.jpg"" alt=""
                Image of a home with mismatched grille patterns captioned with "" Don't Screw This Up! Avoid these three
                grille mistakes when updating a home's windows"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>1. Mismatched Grille Patterns</h2>

        <p>When we see a house with mismatched grille patterns, we often wonder if this was done on purpose or by
            oversight.</p>

        <p>Take the example above. Both of the half round windows have arched grilles dividing the window into fourths
            horizontally and into thirds vertically.</p>

        <p>But the spacing between them is inconsistent, and this creates an overall sloppy look.</p>

        <p>Our guess is that the top window was the original, as it matches the lines of grille pattern in double hung
            below it. When a replacement window was needed for the lower window, this pattern continuation wasn’t
            accounted for.</p>

        <p>While a little variety might seem appealing, resist the urge to mix and match different grille patterns on
            your windows. This creates a visually jarring effect and disrupts the overall flow of your home’s exterior.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Grille Misalignment Between Windows</h2>

        <p>We hate to see a row of windows with grilles that are all slightly askew. It’s a recipe for visual disaster!
        </p>

        <p>Even a minor misalignment can make your windows appear crooked and detract from the clean lines of your home.
        </p>

        <p>The home above is a great example. The lowest grille in the second floor picture window does not alight with
            the middle grilles in the two windows flanking it. It’s probably about a half inch out of alignment.</p>

        <p>It’s unfortunate, because it’s a simple error to avoid, but one that can have a major impact on the finished
            look of your home.</p>

        <h3>There are two ways that this error can happen.</h3>

        <p>When ordering your windows, the company you order from should inform the manufacturer if certain window
            grilles need to be aligned along an elevation (or a side view of your home).</p>

        <p>This is especially critical if windows are slightly different sizes, say because they are in different rooms.
            You still want the exterior view of your home to appear cohesive.</p>

        <p>However, even if the windows were ordered correctly, you can still wind up with misaligned grilles. This is
            indicative of an installation error.</p>

        <p>When you have a professional installing your windows, they should take care to ensure that the windows are
            installed at the proper heights to create consistency in the grille heights when viewed from the exterior.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Grilles Too Thick for Your Windows</h2>

        <p>While grilles offer a touch of elegance, excessively thick ones can become a barrier to the natural light and
            scenic views you crave.</p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/full-frame-or-pocket-insert-replacement-windows/"">We find that
                grilles too large for the window’s glass space most often happens when homeowners opt for pocket insert
                replacement of small windows, such as dormers</a>. This type of replacement results in a smaller amount
            of glass than the original window had. Using the same thickness of grille on reduced glass space can make
            the grilles seem too large for the window they are dividing.</p>

        <p>Better options might be to forego grilles completely, or to opt for a thinner grille piece.</p>

        "<p>Don’t get us wrong, we will always love an oversized picture window that makes you feel like you could step
            right through to the great outdoors. But, we are quickly becoming obsessed with a new design trend in our <a

                windows</strong>.</p>

        <p>In this post, we’re sharing 5 reasons why we think this trend will soon be seen in houses everywhere.</p>

        <p>We’ll also share the #1 thing to be aware of before you decide to hop on the tall, skinny window trend.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pinterest-slim-vertical-windows.jpg""
                alt="" interior of a contemporary house with a black, floor to ceiling slim vertical window. Captioned
                with "" So small, but so much impact: Modern Window Trend Alert! Slim vertical windows"""" width=""
                1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <p>5 Reasons to Love Floor-to-Ceiling Slim Vertical Windows</p>

        <h2>1. Unexpected Natural Light</h2>

        <p>Slim, floor to ceiling windows are a fantastic choice for tight rooms where you don’t have a lot of wall
            space for a double hung, picture, or other type of large window.</p>

        <p>Whether it’s a compact stairwell or a galley kitchen, a slim vertical window can completely change the feel
            of a small, dark space.</p>

        <h2>2. Design Interest</h2>

        <p>The unconventional strip of the outdoors breaking up a large wall commands attention.</p>

        <p>If you’re looking to make a large statement with a very small amount of real estate in your home’s interior,
            this is for sure one way to do it.</p>

        <h2>3. Privacy</h2>

        <p>A thin window can be a great addition to rooms where you would love to look outdoors, but don’t want to risk
            your privacy. Bathrooms are a perfect example.</p>

        <p>A well placed floor-to-ceiling, slim window allows you to soak up the view while you soak in the tub.</p>

        <p>But, because of it’s size and the ability to position it thoughtfully, you can be sure that you don’t risk
            any privacy.</p>

        <p>Of course, if you still have concerns you can always choose privacy glass for the window. Privacy glass
            obscures the view, so that you can still enjoy the light coming through the window without worrying about
            someone being able to see what’s going on inside your home.</p>

        <h2>4. Highlighting The View</h2>

        <p>Speaking of the view, a statement window naturally draws the eye to whatever is visible beyond it.</p>

        <p>Suppose your yard boasts an heirloom tree, or a gorgeous outdoor fountain, or a lovely garden gazebo.</p>

        <p>Why not strategically place a floor-to-ceiling window so that anyone passing by it is invited to enjoy the
            view of your prized outdoor spaces?</p>

        <h2>5. Energy Efficiency</h2>

        <p>The least energy efficient part of any window is the glass.</p>

        <p>It just makes sense that if you reduce the size of the glass, you’ll increase the energy efficiency in your
            home. This can be an especially good design trick to employ to keep down your energy costs in rooms that get
            a ton of natural sunlight.</p>

        <h2>The Important Potential Con to Consider Before you Commit to Slim Vertical Windows</h2>

        <p>While skinny floor-to-ceiling windows offer a plethora of benefits, there’s one important design factor to
            consider before you take the plunge.</p>

        <p>Slim vertical windows don’t always look great with window treatments.</p>

        <p>Much like black windows, slim vertical windows can look fussy and messy when blinds, curtains, or other
            window coverings are added to them.</p>

        <p>This can be fine if your thin window is in an area of your home where you don’t need to block out light to be
            able to sleep, and where privacy isn’t a concern.</p>

        <p>If that’s not the case, you may want to reconsider, or at least reposition, your slim vertical window.</p>

        "<p>In our <a href="" /windows"">Apex, NC area window replacement store</a>, we often hear from homeowners who
            are concerned about condensation outside their windows. They ask <strong>“Does seeing condensation outside
                your windows mean that you need to replace your windows?”</strong></p>

        <p>In this post, we’ll explain what it means if you see condensation outside your windows.</p>

        <p><img src=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pinterest-Condensation-Outside-Your-Windows-Separating-Fact-from-Fiction.jpg""

                Condensation outside your windows: Separating fact from fiction"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500"">
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding the Science Behind Condensation Outside Your Windows</h2>

        <p>Condensation is simply the process of water vapor in the air turning back into liquid water.</p>

        <p>It happens when the air reaches its dew point, the temperature at which it can no longer hold all the
            moisture it contains. When that happens, the excess water condenses on any available surface, including your
            windows.</p>

        <p>Now, normally, we expect condensation to form on the inside of windows, where warm, moist indoor air meets
            the cooler glass. But sometimes, the opposite can happen.</p>

        <h3>This is more likely to occur during:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cool nights and warm days:</strong> When the outside temperature drops faster than the indoor
                temperature, the window glass becomes colder than the dew point of the outside air, leading to
                condensation. With the extreme temperature swings we see in central North Carolina, this is especially
                common.</li>
            <li><strong>High humidity:</strong> If the air outside is very humid, it’s more likely to reach its dew
                point and condense on your windows. This is true even if the temperature isn’t that cold (and again, can
                be especially true here in North Carolina).</li>
            <li><strong>Calm conditions:</strong> Wind can help whisk away moisture, so condensation is less likely on
                windy nights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is Outside Condensation Good or Bad?</h2>

        <p>Contrary to popular belief, condensation on the outside of your windows is generally good news. It indicates
            two things:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Effective Insulation:</strong> Your windows are doing their job! They’re preventing the warm,
                moist air inside your home from escaping and cooling the exterior glass. This means your windows are
                well-sealed and energy-efficient, keeping your heating bills low.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate Humidity Levels:</strong> Outside condensation suggests that your home’s humidity is
                within a healthy range (ideally between 30-50%). This reduces the risk of mold growth and other
                moisture-related problems inside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What if the Condensation is Between the Panes of Glass?</h2>

        <p>If you see fogging or condensation building up between the panes of glass, this is a sign that your windows
            have seal failure. This IS a problem that you should address immediately. <a href=""

            is: <strong>Does replacing windows increase home value?</strong></p>

        <p>Replacing your home’s windows is a significant investment, but it can also pay off by increasing your home’s
            value.  Read on to learn exactly which window upgrades can increase your home’s value.</p>

        <p><img src=""

                1500""></p>

        <p>According to the <a href="" https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2023/"">2023 Cost vs. Value report
                from Remodeling magazine</a>, replacing vinyl windows in central North Carolina adds an average of
            $13,776 to a home’s value, or about 69% of the cost of the project. Replacing wood windows adds an average
            of $14,912 to a home’s value or about 61% of the cost of the project. These figures are based on projects
            where 10 windows were replaced, none of which were specialty sizes or shapes.</p>

        <p>However, it’s important to note that the actual increase in home value from new windows will vary depending
            on a number of factors, including:</p>

        <h3>The Quality of Windows You Choose</h3>

        <p>Higher-quality windows will typically add more value to your home than lower-quality windows.</p>

        <p>So, while replacing vinyl windows with new vinyl windows may cost less, you will see more value added to your
            home if you replace them with aluminum or fiberglass windows. It’s also true that you’ll experience some
            cost savings as a result of the improved energy efficiency.</p>

        <p>This is especially true if the window offers transferable warranties that the new homeowner can use should
            they encounter any issues with the window in the future.</p>

        <h3>The Condition of Your Existing Windows</h3>

        <p>If your existing windows are old and in poor condition, replacing them with new windows will likely add more
            value to your home than if your existing windows are in good condition.</p>

        <h2>The Overall Condition of Your Home</h2>

        <p>If your home is in good condition and in a desirable location, new windows will likely add more value than if
            your home is in poor condition or in a less desirable location.</p>

            <li><strong>Enhanced Durability:</strong> Say goodbye to frequent repainting and fretting about wood rot.
                Cladding stands steadfast against rain, wind, and UV rays, significantly extending the lifespan of your
                windows, often by decades.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal Maintenance:</strong> Forget about endless scraping and sanding! Cladding boasts
                low-maintenance appeal, freeing you from the traditional wooden window chore cycle. Simply wipe clean
                and bask in the unobstructed views.</li>
            <li><strong>Boosted Energy Efficiency:</strong> Many cladding materials boast exceptional insulating
                properties, keeping your interiors warmer in winter and cooler in summer. This translates to reduced
                energy bills and a more comfortable living environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Uncompromised Aesthetics:</strong> Beauty doesn’t get sacrificed at the altar of practicality.
                Cladding comes in a diverse palette of colors and textures, allowing seamless integration with your
                architectural style, be it classic, contemporary, or anything in between.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is Window Cladding Made From?</h2>

        <p>When it comes to cladding your windows, you have options, each with its own unique strengths:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vinyl:</strong> The budget-friendly champion, vinyl cladding is affordable, low-maintenance, and
                available in a vast array of colors. Perfect for projects seeking value without compromising aesthetics.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Aluminum:</strong> This sleek and modern option offers superior strength, lightweight
                construction, and fire resistance. Ideal for homeowners prioritizing durability and a contemporary look.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fiberglass:</strong> The ultimate blend of strength, insulation, and beauty, fiberglass cladding
                is the top choice for those seeking the best. Its exceptional performance and timeless appeal come at a
                premium price point but offer unmatched value in the long run.</li>
            <li><strong>Composite:</strong> Many window companies create their own proprietary composite to use as a
                cladding material. Examples are Marvin’s Ultrex and Andersen’s Fibrex. These are generally made of a
                fiberglass base with additional materials added to enhance durability, environmental friendliness, and
                energy efficiency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Can I Have Cladding Only on the Outside of a Window?</h2>

        <p>Yes!</p>

        <p>Many homeowners want the durability of a clad window on the exterior of their home, and the warmth of wood on
            the interior.</p>

        <p>A wide variety of windows offer this exact option. This is especially great for homeowners here in the
            Raleigh, NC area. The humidity and general unpredictability of our weather can be especially tough on wood,
            and over time causes wood rot and expansion issues.</p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/andersen-window-series-an-in-depth-product-comparison/"">In this
                article, a detailed comparison of each of Andersen’s window series</a>, we note that 4 of Andersen’s 5
            window series offer a clad exterior with a wood interior.</p>

        <h2>Does Cladding Come on a New Window? Or is it Applied Separately?</h2>

        <p>Windows are custom-made at the time they ordered. This allows each window order to made to the unique
            specifications that each homeowner wants.</p>

        <p>Cladding is one of those specifications. When you order a certain window, it will be manufactured with
            cladding applied to the wood.</p>

        <p>Cladding is not a material that is applied on-site or that can be applied after a window has been installed.

            actually wind up costing you more money in the long run.</p>

        <p>Read on to learn which window replacement cost saving tips we recommend you avoid. We’ll explain exactly how
            they’ll end up costing you more, not less.</p>

        <h1>Five “Money Saving Tips” for Buying New Windows in Raleigh, NC That Will Wind Up Costing You Money</h1>

        <h3>1. Buying Used Windows</h3>

        <p>We’ve been in business in the Raleigh, NC area since 2007. In that time, we’ve helped thousands of homeowners
            replace their windows. We can think of exactly two projects where homeowners replaced perfectly functional
            windows for purely aesthetic reasons.</p>

        <p>Bottom line: If someone went to the time, trouble, and cost to replace their home’s windows, there was
            probably something wrong with the original windows.</p>

        <p>Steer clear of Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist ads for “good condition used windows”. They will almost
            certainly lead to issues with leakage, seal failure, or other problems that will cost you time and money to
            fix.</p>

        <h3>2. Using Bargain Window Installation Materials</h3>

        <p>We use some of the top-of-the-line materials when it comes to installing windows.</p>

        <p>For example, we use silicone-based expansion caulk instead of regular construction caulk.</p>

        <p>Yes, it costs 4 times more than the caulk they have in bulk at the big box store.</p>

        <p>But it lasts years longer, and will expand and contract with your windows, preventing rot and warp issues.
        </p>

        <p>It may seem wise to use cheaper materials when you’re setting a budget for your project. But, a little more
            spent on materials upfront will wind up saving you a ton in maintenance down the road.</p>

        <h3>3. Reusing Moulding and Casing Materials When Replacing Your Windows</h3>

        <p>Sometimes, homeowners will ask us if we can save their old moulding or casing to reuse during their window
            replacement project. Their logic makes sense; if it’s the windows, and not the casing, that need
            replacement, why pay for a new casing?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, what we often see is that reused moulding materials become brittle during removal. Typically,
            a good portion of them will wind up breaking or becoming warped beyond salvage. This means spending valuable
            time sourcing replacement moulding.</p>

        <p>Our advice? Budget for all new mouldings and casings at the start of your project.* That way there won’t be
            any unexpected surprises on installation day.</p>

        <p><em>*Our only caveat to this is if you have a very unique moulding, such as for an arch-top window. If that’s
                the case, then it may make more financial sense to reuse your moulding.</em></p>

        <h3>4. Splitting Your Project Into Phases</h3>

        <p>Yes, replacing some of your windows now and the rest later may help you spend less money now. Overall,
            however, your project will wind up costing more.</p>

        <p>There are two reasons for this:</p>

        <p>One is that you will be paying more for labor and related construction costs (dump fees, etc.) by having an
            installation crew come to your home for multiple window replacement projects.</p>

        <p>The other is that window companies typically have annual price increases on their windows. Unless you
            complete both phases of your project within the same year, you will wind up paying more for the same windows
            by delaying part of your project.</p>

                you decide that you absolutely must split your window replacement project into phases, be sure to follow
                our guide on the smart way to do so.</a></p>

        <h3>5. Not Knowing Exactly What You Want</h3>

        <p>Windows are complicated to purchase. Nearly every aspect of a window, from the material it’s made of to the
            color to the way it’s installed is customized to your specific needs.</p>

        <p>Not knowing exactly what you want before you order windows can be a costly mistake to make for several
            reasons.</p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/updated-energy-star-certification-requirements/"">What if your new
                windows don’t meet the 2023 updated Energy Star requirements, and don’t pass inspection?</a></p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/full-frame-or-pocket-insert-replacement-windows/"">Or what if you
                pay the increased cost for a full frame replacement when a less expensive pocket insert replacement
                would have been just fine for your needs?</a></p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/why-are-windows-so-expensive/"">Unfortunately, a mistake made
                ordering windows can cost you thousands of dollars.</a></p>

        <p>But don’t worry, you don’t need to be overwhelmed by the cost and the multitude of decisions to make.</p>

        "<p>The allure of a pet door is undeniable. Freedom for your furry friend means less hassle for you. But you may
            be wondering, “<strong>Is if good or bad to install a pet door</strong>? Could it damage my door?”</p>

        <p>This is a question that homeowners sometimes ask when they visit our <a href="" /doors"">door supply showroom
                in Apex, NC</a>.</p>

        <p>Read on to learn all about how pet doors affect your door and your home.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pinterest-pet-door.jpg"" alt="" a black
                cat goes through a pet door in a modern home. The image is captioned with "" A door expert's verdict: Is
                it good or bad to install a pet door?"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>There Are Some Benefits to Your Door of Installing a Pet Door</h2>

        <p>Of course, we know your pet would say that a pet door is a great idea!</p>

        <p>But, there are some ways that installing a pet door might benefit your door. The main one is reduced wear and
            tear. Your pet will no longer scratch at the door to request to go in or out. This means that your door will
            have fewer unsightly scratches and dings.</p>

        <p>It’s also true that pet doors can slightly improve the ventilation in your home. By acting as a mini-vent, a
            pet door can promote air circulation and preventing moisture buildup.</p>

        <h2>The Downsides of Installing a Pet Door</h2>

        <p>Of course, there are also some potential negative consequences to your door and your home of installing a pet
            door.</p>

        <p>The primary con of a pet door is its impact on your door’s structural integrity. Cutting a hole in your door
            weakens its function, potentially affecting insulation and soundproofing. This is especially true for solid
            wood doors, as cutting into them makes them especially prone to warping and rotting.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, pet doors can disrupt the seal between the door and frame, leading to drafts and increased
            energy costs.</p>

        <p>Some homeowners are persuaded to skip a pet door when we explain the increased maintenance requirements that
            their door will have. Depending on the type, pet doors may require regular cleaning and repairs to flaps,
            locks, and weatherproofing.</p>

        <h2>Only Flush Panel Doors Can Support a Pet Door</h2>

        <p>Lastly, it’s important to consider if your door can support a pet door. Only doors with flush lower panels
            can be modified for a pet door. Door manufacturers will not be able to add a pet door to doors that include
            beveling or other cutouts where the pet door will be installed.</p>

        <p>Door manufacturers can only install pet doors on flush panels. Beveled doors, like this one, can’t support a
            pet door.</p>

        <h2>Pet Door Installation in Apex, NC</h2>

        <p>Of course, the choice of whether to install a pet door is a personal one, and you should do what’s best for
            your family (including its four-legged members).</p>

        <p>Whether you decide that it’s good or bad to install a pet door, when you’re deciding on new doors for your
            home, you want to work with experts who can help you understand your options.</p>

            find Dutch doors inside the home to be charming and very functional. In this post, we’ll share the 5 best
            rooms for a Dutch door inside your house in Raleigh, NC.</p>

        <h2><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pinterest-interior-dutch.jpg"" alt=""

                5"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500"">
            What is a Dutch Door?</h2>

        <p>A Dutch door is a door that is split in half horizontally. You may have only the bottom closed so that the
            top swings freely open, or you may close both halves.</p>

        <p>Dutch Doors are known by many other names, including:
            • Stable doors
            • Barn doors
            • Double hung doors
            • Half doors</p>

        <p>Whatever you call them, these doors have a long history.</p>

        <p>The style originated in the Netherlands in the 1600s. At the time, these doors were popular among farming
            families who used them to keep children in and animals out.</p>

        <p>When Dutch settlers came to the US, they brought the style with them in rural parts of New England.</p>

        <p>Since then, door manufacturers have adapted Dutch doors for use in many home architectural styles. You can
            find Dutch doors in farmhouses, traditional and even contemporary homes.</p>

        <p>Recently, Dutch doors have become trendy both as an exterior and an interior door option.</p>

        <p>When homeowners visit our <a href="" /doors"">Raleigh, NC area store for new doors</a>, they sometimes ask:
        </p>

        <h2>What are the Best Rooms for a Dutch Door?</h2>

        <h3>1. Mudroom</h3>

        <p>Shoes scattered, coats flung, muddy paw prints galore – the typical mudroom mayhem.</p>

        <p>But a Dutch door transforms the scene. Messy kids and pets can be contained on one side of the divide, while
            towels, wipes, etc. can be handed over to the partition.</p>

        <p>Don’t want your pet or kiddos to escape, but need to grab something from the mudroom? Just keep the lower
            portion closed while you open the top to grab what you need without freeing your crew.</p>

        <p>No time to clean up the mess before the company arrives? Just close the top portion of the door!</p>

        <h3>2. Pantry</h3>

        <p>Similarly, a Dutch door can be a lifesaver when you don’t want kids or pets to have free access to the
            pantry, but you want to be able to hand things over from inside, or reach in to grab something.</p>

        <h3>3. Laundry Room</h3>

        <p>A Dutch door allows you to work on laundry while keeping little ones (of the four and two-legged varieties)
            out of your workspace (and away from harmful chemicals you may keep in the laundry room).</p>

        <p>But, with the top portion of the door open, you can still easily supervise them and offer assistance when
            they need help opening a snack…because they always need help opening a snack!</p>

        <h3>4. Kids’ Room</h3>

        <p>Many parents opt for a Dutch door in lieu of a baby gate to keep their little ones contained. The Dutch door
            is a sturdier option, which won’t damage your walls the way a baby gate can if it’s dislodged.</p>

        <p>Dutch doors are also a fantastic option if you want to be sure that a roaming pet doesn’t wander in and wake
            up a sleeping baby.</p>

        <p>Just be sure that no one teaches Junior how fun it is to swing on the bottom half of the door!</p>

        <h3>5. Home Office</h3>

        <p>Similar to a laundry room, a Dutch door on a home office gives you a physical barrier that can prevent the
            chaos of family life from overtaking your workspace. Keeping the top door open while you work allows you to
            keep one ear on the family while you work.</p>

        <p>When you have an important meeting? Just close the top door to take your call.</p>

        <h2>Multipoint Lock Maintenance: 4 Essential Steps to Keep Your Front Door Secure in Holly Springs, NC</h2>

        <p>Multipoint lock systems offer superior security for your doors, engaging at multiple points for enhanced
            protection against forced entry.</p>

        <p>Doors with these locks typically have three or more locking points – top, middle, and bottom – activated by a
            single handle or key turn. These points engage with corresponding strikers on the door frame, creating a
            secure hold.</p>

        <p>But like any mechanical system, they require regular maintenance to function well.</p>

        <h2>The Maintenance Essentials for Multipoint Lock Doors</h2>

        <p><strong>1. Visual Inspection:</strong> Look for signs of wear and tear regularly. These include loose screws,
            damaged components, or misaligned strikers. Address these issues promptly to prevent malfunction.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Testing and Adjustment:</strong> Regularly test the lock by engaging and disengaging it multiple
            times. If it feels stiff or requires excessive force, minor adjustments might be necessary. Consult your
            lock manual or seek professional help for adjustments.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Cleaning:</strong> Dust, dirt, and debris can clog the mechanism. Use a soft brush or vacuum
            cleaner to remove debris from the lock and strikers. Do this at least once per year.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Lubrication:</strong> Friction is the enemy of smooth operation. Apply a silicone-based lubricant
            (avoid WD-40, which can attract dirt) to the lock mechanism, keyhole, and all moving parts at least
            annually.</p>

        <p>Read on to learn about how thermal break doors can improve your home’s energy efficiency.</p>

                break doors improve your home's energy efficiency"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>What is a Thermal Break?</h2>

        <p>A thermal break is a barrier that is placed between the inner and outer frame of a door. It is made of a
            material that does not conduct heat well, such as fiberglass, resin, or other composite materials.</p>

        <p>The purpose of a thermal break is to prevent heat from transferring from the inside to the outside of the
            home, or vice versa. This can help to improve the energy efficiency of your home and save you money on your
            heating and cooling bills.</p>

        <h2>How Does a Thermal Break Work?</h2>

        <p>When heat passes through a material, it is transferred from one molecule to another. The faster the molecules
            move, the hotter the material is.</p>

        <p>Materials that conduct heat well, such as metal, have molecules that move quickly. Materials that do not
            conduct heat well, such as fiberglass, have molecules that move slowly.</p>

        <p>A thermal break works by interrupting the flow of heat through a door. Placed inside the frame of the door,
            the barrier serves to prevent heat and cold from easily transferring from outside your home to inside, and
            visa versa.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Thermal Breaks</h2>

        <p>There are several benefits to having a thermal break on your doors and windows. These include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved energy efficiency:</strong> Thermal breaks can help to improve the energy efficiency of
                your home by preventing heat from transferring from the inside to the outside, or visa versa. This can
                save you money on your heating and cooling bills.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced condensation:</strong> Thermal breaks can help to reduce condensation doors.
                Condensation occurs when warm, humid air meets a cold surface. The thermal break creates a barrier that
                prevents the warm air from reaching the cold surface, which can help to reduce condensation. This can,
                over time, prevent water damage inside your home at the door’s threshold.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased durability:</strong> Thermal breaks can help to increase the durability of your doors.
                They can protect the frames from the elements and prevent them from warping or cracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Added security:</strong> Thermal breaks can help to increase the security of your home. They can
                make it more difficult for burglars to break into your home through a door.</li>
        </ul>

        "<p>Many smart homeowners ask <strong>“What’s the best season to replace a front door in Apex, NC”?</strong> It
            makes sense that you’d want to keep your door replacement project as stress-free as possible. If there’s an
            ideal season in which to replace your front door, then that’s when you’d want to schedule your door
            replacement project.</p>

        <p>At Window Works Co., we help <a href="" /doors"">homeowners in the Apex, NC area find the best front doors
                for their homes</a>. We know that there isn’t really a ‘best’ season to replace your own front door. But
            we also know that each season presents certain benefits while also posing potential challenges.</p>

        <p>In the post, we’ll explain what’s great (and perhaps not so great) about replacing your front door each
            season.</p>

                the best season to replace a front door in North Carolina?"" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>What Season are YOU in?</h2>

        <p>Maybe more important than the calendar season is thinking about the season of life that you, the homeowner,
            are in.</p>

        <p>Is there a big event coming up, like a graduation or a holiday? Perhaps you want to welcome friends and
            family into your home through a stunning new front door. Then of course it makes sense that you’d want to
            have your door replacement project complete before the big day!</p>

        <p>Or do you have a new baby at home who will be walking in a few months? Perhaps it would be less stressful for
            you to have the door replaced before the baby takes those first steps. That way, you won’t have to worry
            about her toddling into a construction zone while your door is being replaced.</p>

        <p>Maybe you have an elderly pet who would be stressed by a construction project? Then perhaps you’d rather wait
            until your pet has passed before starting a construction project. That way you can be assured the time you
            have with them isn’t stressful for them.</p>

        <p>Whatever your circumstances, it’s important to consider your needs first when planning when to replace your
            front door.</p>

        <h2>Is Spring the Best Season to Replace a Front Door?</h2>

        <p>Spring weather is generally mild, and sunshine is abundant.</p>

        <p>For many, this makes spring an ideal time to replace a front door.</p>

        <p>But, there is one major caveat to consider.</p>

        <p>Beginning in mid-March and lasting through the end of April, pine pollen season is a time that many North
            Carolinians dread. Everything from cars to patio furniture to pets gets coated in a thick layer of yellow
            crud.</p>

        <p>Rain doesn’t wash it away. It only creates messy rivers of yellow goo running down the streets and pooling in
            parking lots.</p>

        <p>Those who suffer from seasonal allergies are easy to spot. They’ll be the ones with swollen eyes and drippy
            noses.</p>

        <p>If you or a family member suffer from pollen allergies, you may want to reconsider a springtime door
            replacement.</p>

        <p>That’s because, during a door replacement project, your entryway will be open. It will remain open for much
            of the day while the installation crew changes out your old door for your new one.</p>

        <p>During that time, lots of pollen particles might enter your home.</p>

        <p>If you’re OK with this (and the additional furniture dusting or nose-blowing that it might mean), then spring
            may still be a great time for you to change out your front door.</p>

        <h2>Is Summer the Best Season to Replace a Front Door?</h2>

        <p>The longer daytime hours can make Summer a great choice for a door replacement project.</p>

        <p>But the summer heat in North Carolina can be stifling. And the high humidity can leave you dripping wet after
            only a few minutes outside.</p>

        <p>Some homeowners think that their front entryway will be open for much of the day during a front door
            replacement. They worry that their home will become unbearably hot due to the AC loss. However, on most
            front door replacement installations, the front door opening is only exposed for 30 minutes or less.</p>

        <p>But, if your front door replacement involves rot repair or other complications, the front door may be off its
            hinges for longer. You may lose some of your home’s air conditioning power throughout the day because of
            this.</p>

        <p>This could be fine if you aren’t terribly bothered by heat, or if you plan to supplement your A/C with fans
            until the HVAC is able to recuperate from the project.</p>

        <p>But, if you are quite sensitive to heat, and if your project is complicated by additional repairs around the
            door frame, you may want to choose a different season for your door replacement project.</p>

        <h2>Is Autumn the Best Season to Replace a Front Door?</h2>

        <p>Cooling temperatures can make autumn an ideal time to replace your front door.</p>

        <p>However, sometimes unexpected weather can cause delays in construction.</p>

        <p>The Atlantic Coast hurricane season runs from June 1 – November 30. The peak times for a hurricane to affect
            central North Carolina are from mid-August through the end of October. While it is rare for hurricanes to
            impact us here in the Triangle region, it isn’t unheard of.</p>

        <p>It’s important to remember that construction projects can only happen in safe weather conditions. Obviously,
            if power is down, your door project can’t happen as planned. The installation crew won’t be able to use the
            power tools needed to cut your mouldings and casing.</p>

        <p>So, while it is rare, it is possible that hurricane season could cause a delay in your construction project.
            So long as you schedule your project knowing this may happen and affect your timeline, fall can be an
            excellent time to replace a front door in NC.</p>

        <h2>Is Winter the Best Season to Replace a Front Door?</h2>

        <p>Winter can be a fine season to replace a front door. Our winter temperatures are generally mild relative to
            those in other states.</p>

        <p>The door opening should only be exposed for about 30 minutes on typical front door replacements. As we
            described above, however, it may take longer if there is rot or other issues for the installation crew to
            repair. In these cases, some of your home’s heating power may be lost due to the entryway being open during
            the project. The solution to this, though, could be as simple as wearing a sweater during the project.</p>

        <p>As with autumn, there is a risk of some weather delay. It’s rare, but snow (and more commonly, ice) can make
            roads unpassable and cause delays to your door replacement project. So long as you know that this is a
            (slight) risk when you schedule a winter door replacement, you should be just fine.</p>

        <h2>What are Pass-Through Windows?</h2>

        <p>A pass-through window accentuates indoor-outdoor living spaces. The opening creates a beautiful and
            functional indoor-outdoor living.</p>

        <p>They are typically found in kitchens, usually above countertops. That way food and drinks can be easily
            passed between the kitchen and an outdoor entertaining space.</p>

        <p>Pass-through windows are also great options in basement bars, laundry rooms, and other areas where there is a
            need for easy access between adjacent spaces.</p>

        <p>There are many options for sills on pass-through windows, including some which are completely flat, or flush.
            This seamless opening allows food, drinks, and other items to be easily passed through the window opening.
        </p>

        <p>There are a few different types of pass-through windows, including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sliding windows:</strong> These windows slide open and closed horizontally, like a sliding door.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Folding windows:</strong> These windows fold open like an accordion.</li>
            <li><strong>Crank windows:</strong> These windows crank open and closed (can crank upwards or to the side)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Does Pass-Through Windows Cost?</h2>

        <p>The functionality and fun of a pass-through window make it appealing to many homeowners.  These windows offer
            aesthetic interest and a quick and easy way to double a home’s entertaining space.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, for most homeowners, pass-through windows are cost-prohibitive to install.</p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/why-are-windows-so-expensive/"">A window’s cost reflects the
                research and engineering design that went into its development</a>.</p>

        <p>A true pass-through window, that will be energy efficient and keep out the elements without a seam, is a
            marvel of modern engineering. The prices reflect this.</p>

        <p><strong>That’s why many of the top window and door manufacturers offer a pass-through window that isn’t a
                window at all.</strong></p>

        <h2>The #1 Best Kept Secret About Pass-Through Windows</h2>

        <p>A quick search for pass-through windows on Instagram or <a href=""
                https://www.pinterest.com/windowworksco/pass-through-windows/"">Pinterest</a> will show you plenty of
            gorgeous options.</p>

        <p>This might make you think that these trendy windows are common and easy to order.</p>

        <p>Surprisingly, however, most of the major American window brands don’t actually make a pass-through window.
        </p>

        <p>This includes top window manufacturers like Marvin, Pella, and Andersen.</p>

        <p>That’s because the pass-through windows they offer are actually sliding doors!</p>

        <p>Here’s a quote for a pass-through window from Andersen. You can see that the “window” is actually a
            Multi-Glide patio door.</p>

        <p>The door has just been sized down to the impossibly small dimensions of 84 in X 48 in.</p>

        </p>

        <h2>What are the Signs of the Best Window Installation?</h2>

        <p>Before we outline the clues that let you know a window has been poorly installed, let’s first explain what
            makes a good window installation.</p>

        <p>It’s important to know this, because <strong>the best, most energy-efficient window will eventually fail if
                it is poorly installed.</strong></p>

        <p>To be properly installed, a window must be:
            1. Plum
            2. Level
            3. Square</p>

        <p>A <strong>plum</strong> window has sides that are perfectly perpendicular to the level sill.</p>

        <p>A <strong>level</strong> window is one that is level across the span of both the sill and the top of the
            frame.</p>

        <p>For a window to be <strong>square</strong>, each corner must be 90 degrees. The window should not be
            ‘racked’, meaning that one or more angles are less than 90 degrees, and one or more angles are more than 90
            degrees.</p>

        <h3>Additionally, a well-installed window will allow for natural expansion and contraction.</h3>

        <p>This is especially important here in central North Carolina, where we can easily see 70° temperature swings
            in the span of a few days. These changes in temperature, as well as the humidity we experience in the Wake
            County area, mean lots of expansion and contraction in materials like wood, vinyl, PVC, and aluminum. Your
            windows must allow for the natural expansion and contraction that will impact your home. Expansion and
            contraction affects:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your home’s exterior (brick, siding, etc.),</li>
            <li>Your window frame,</li>
            <li>Your window’s casing or moulding, and</li>
            <li>The caulk used as a sealant</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With so many individual aspects affected, it’s easy to see that a window that isn’t designed to factor in
            expansion and contraction is a window that will fail.</p>

        <h3>There are two ways that a good window installation accounts for expansion and contraction.</h3>

        <p><strong>1. By having a correct expansion joint.</strong> An expansion joint is the space left around the
            window during the installation process. This gap between the window frame and your home’s siding allows both
            materials to expand and contract with the weather. Without this, a window may butt up against the siding
            when it expands. This can cause the window to bow and warp because it didn’t have ample room to expand. We
            recommend an expansion joint of 5/16 inch for most projects. Of course, we may recommend something different
            for your home depending on the specific materials used.</p>

        <p><strong>2. By using excellent, silicone-based caulk.</strong> The ‘exterior’ caulk available at most big box
            home supply stores does not adequately flex based on the weather. Over time, it tends to become brittle and
            crack, making your windows vulnerable to gaps, rot, and other issues. Many of the signs of a bad window
            installation that we’ll detail below are caused by installers using the wrong caulk. A good window
            installation uses a strong, flexible, silicone-based caulk that will expand and contract to allow natural
            movement.</p>

        <h2>Signs of a Bad Window Installation</h2>

        <p>Now that we’ve outlined the hallmarks of a well installed window, let’s outline what are the 7 telltale signs
            of a bad window installation.</p>

        <h3>1. A Window That Doesn’t Open is a Sign of a Bad Window Installation</h3>

        <p>If a window won’t open, it means that the moving parts of the window can’t operate, because the frame can’t
            glide in the frame.</p>

        <p>Generally, this reflects that the window was not plumb, level, and/or square when installed.</p>

        <h3>2. A Window That Doesn’t Lock is a Sign of a Bad Window Installation</h3>

        <p>Similar to a window that won’t open, a window not locking means that the lock and keeper are no longer in
            alignment.</p>

        <p>This reflects that the window is not plumb, level, and/or square in the rough opening.</p>

        <h3>3. A Window That Lets in Rain, Wind, Dust, or Bugs is a Sign of a Bad Window Installation</h3>

        <p>If you stand near a poorly installed window, you may feel a draft. Or worse, you may see water or even bugs
            coming in through a closed window.</p>

        <h3>4. A Window That Won’t Stay In Place is a Sign of a Bad Window Installation</h3>

        <p>If you move the sashes on your single or double hung window (LINK), they should stay in place.</p>

        <p>If you see them creep, or even worse, drop quickly after you move them, that’s a telltale sign of a bad
            window installation.</p>

        <h3>5. A Window Sill That Isn’t Level is a Sign of a Bad Window Installation</h3>

        <p>If you look at your window with either the sash slightly raised or the casement slightly cranked out, you
            should see an even space between the sash and sill.</p>

        <p>In the construction industry, this space is referred to as ‘<strong>The Reveal</strong>‘.</p>

        <p>This distance should be the same across the span of the window. If it’s not, it’s a surefire sign the window
            is somehow out of alignment and is either bowed, crowned, or angled.</p>

        <h3>6. Poor Caulking is a Sign of a Bad Window Installation</h3>

        <p>Caulk seals the gaps between the frame and the moulding or casing around the window. Caulk is also important
            to allow the window space to expand and contract based on heat and humidity.</p>

        <p>A well-done caulk job will not be noticeable. A poorly done caulk job, with globs and beads of caulk in some
            spots, and thin or tearing caulk in others.</p>

        <p>While this may seem to just be unsightly, over time, this inconsistent caulking can lead to many of the
            issues we’ve already described. You may notice wind or moisture entering through the frame. Or, you observe
            some of the functioning issues we’ve described, like trouble opening, latching, or staying put when opened.
        </p>

        <p>Or, the window installer may have used the wrong type of caulk. While acrylic caulk is readily available and
            relatively cheap, over time it dries and becomes brittle, and thus doesn’t move with the window. In some
            cases, this can cause water leakage issues over time.</p>

        <p>We recommend a silicone-based caulk, which is a more durable and elastic product that will move with your
            window for years to come.</p>

        <h3>7. A Window That Doesn’t Have a Proper Expansion Joint is a Sign of a Bad Window Installation</h3>

        <p>An expansion joint is the space left around the window to account for changes in materials around the window
            as they expand and contract with the weather.</p>

        <p>For most window projects, we recommend installing an expansion joint of 5/16 inch.</p>

        <p>We frequently see windows installed with either too large a gap for an expansion joint or with no space at
            all.</p>

        <p>Too large of a gap will result in caulk breaking down over time because it is filling too much space to be
            functional.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, too small of a gap will cause the window frame to bow when it tries to expand but has no
            room to do so. This leads to many of the issues we’ve described above.</p>

        "<p>When choosing windows for a new home, or when replacing existing windows, you may have to choose between
            single-hung and double-hung windows.</p>

        <p>Many homeowners who visit our <a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/windows/"">window showroom close to
                Apex, NC,</a> wonder which window type will be better for their home.</p>

        <p>While every project and family is unique, as a general rule, we recommend that homeowners opt for double-hung
            windows. Here are five undeniable reasons why we believe that double-hung windows are better than
            single-hung windows.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pinterest-double-hung.jpg"" alt="" brown
                midcentury modern couch with pillows in a living room in front of two double hung white windows""
                width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>What’s the Difference between Single-Hung and Double-Hung Windows?</h2>

        <p>Before outlining why we’d encourage you to choose a double-hung window over a single-hung window, it’s
            important to understand the differences between the two types of windows.</p>

        <p>Double-hung windows (also known as <strong>‘Up and Down Windows’</strong>) and single-hung windows look
            similar to one another. Both feature two sashes within a single window frame.</p>

        <p>However, on a single-hung window, only the lower sash is operable. This means that you can move the bottom
            sash up to open the window. But the upper sash is stationary, and you cannot move it.</p>

        <p>By contrast, on a double-hung window, both sashes are operable. You can open the window just by lowering the
            top sash or by raising the lower sash. Or, you could move both sashes to the middle of the window frame,
            creating airflow at both the top and bottom of the window.</p>

        <h2>5 Undeniable Reasons Why Double-Hung Windows Are Better than Single-Hung Windows</h2>

        <p>Now that you know the differences between the two types of windows, let’s consider the benefits offered by a
            double-hung window.</p>

        <h3>1. Double-hung windows are Easier to Clean</h3>

        <p>Nowadays, most double-hung windows feature a tilt-in option.</p>

        <p>This allows you to clean both the inside and outside of the window from inside your home.</p>

        <p>Not having to climb a ladder to clean the exterior of second-story windows is a major selling point that
            leads many homeowners to choose double-hung windows.</p>

        <h3>2. They Can be Safer for Kids and Pets</h3>

        <p>If you want to open your window to let air in, you may worry that kids or pets might fall through the open
            lower window sash.</p>

        <p>A double-hung window allows you to open the top sash of the window, preventing kids and pets from having
            access to the open portion of the window.</p>

        <h3>3. They are Available in More Durable Materials and Offer More Customization Options</h3>

        <p>It’s true that most major window lines offer a single-hung window. However, in most high-quality window
            brands (such as Andersen, ProVia, Marvin, and Pella), a single-hung option is only available in their basic
            grade window line.</p>

        <p>By switching to a double-hung window, you can typically get a window made of more durable material.</p>

        <p>Also, a single-hung window will generally not offer the customization options that most homeowners are
            looking for. Choices like custom sizes, colors, and finishes, are usually not an option (or the options are
            extremely limited) in the window lines that offer single-hung windows.</p>

        <h3>4. Double-hung windows Allow a Cross-Breeze</h3>

        <p>By opening both the top and bottom of a double-hung window, you can create a cross-breeze in your room.</p>

        <p>This can help homeowners keep their homes cool in the summer and warm in the winter.</p>

        <h3>5. Double-Hung Windows are Just as Energy Efficient as Single-Hung Windows</h3>

        <p>Many homeowners are told by contractors and even other window suppliers that single-hung windows are more
            energy-efficient than double-hung windows. The theory goes that, because there are fewer moving parts, there
            is less energy loss on a single-hung window.</p>

        <p>When we talk to homeowners who’ve been told this, we encourage them to compare the energy efficiency of
            single-hung versus double-hung windows of the same type. When they do, they quickly see that the energy
            efficiency ratings are the same.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, we find that this worn-out and untrue sentiment is usually relayed to homeowners by folks who
            only sell lower-quality single-hung windows.</p>

        <p>As always, that’s why recommend that you do your research and understand your options before committing to a
            particular window. (LINK)</p>

        <h2>When to Choose a Single-Hung Window</h2>

        <p>Of course, when it comes to windows for your home, there are always exceptions to rules. There are several
            legitimate reasons why you might choose a single-hung window over a double-hung window.</p>

        <h4>When You’re Hoping to Cut Costs</h4>

        <p>As a general rule, a double-hung window will cost more than a single-hung window of the same type. If you’re
            looking to save money on your window order, you may want to opt for single-hung windows.</p>

        <h4>When You Need Peace of Mind that Your Windows are Locked</h4>

        <p>Some single-hung windows automatically latch when the operable sash is closed. For instance, the Andersen 100
            Series window offers this functionality.</p>

        <p>If you struggle to remember whether you’ve locked your windows for home security, you may appreciate this
            feature.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>Deciding if double-hung windows are better than single-hung windows is just one of many choices you’ll make
            when you’re buying new windows. As you evaluate your options, it’s important to work with unbiased pros who
            will hear your concerns, answer your questions, and offer unbiased guidance.</p>

        <h2>There Are Several Reasons That You May Be Interested in Installing Your Own Windows:</h2>

        <p><strong>1. If You Only Need to Replace A Small Number Of Windows.</strong> At Window Works Co., we require a
            minimum of 5 windows in order for our installation crew to install new or replacement windows. Many
            homeowners who only need to replace a few windows, or who are <a href=""

                their window replacement project into phases</a>, choose to install their own windows.</p>

        <p><strong>2. You want to Better Understand Your New Windows.</strong> Handy homeowners sometimes choose to
            install their own windows so that they have a better understanding of the mechanical workings of their new
            windows.</p>

        <p><strong>3. To Save Money.</strong> Cost savings is the reason that most readily comes to mind when most
            people imagine installing their own windows. However, it’s important to consider the costs associated with
            window installation, to be sure that DIY-ing this project will actually save you money.</p>

        <h2>What You Need to Install Your Own Andersen Windows</h2>

        <p>If you choose to install your own Andersen Windows, there are several tools you’ll need:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Safety glasses</li>
            <li>Caulk gun</li>
            <li>Waterproof shims</li>
            <li>Tape measure</li>
            <li>Level</li>
            <li>Hammer</li>
            <li>Power drill/driver</li>
            <li>Screwdriver</li>
            <li>Putty knife</li>
            <li>Utility knife</li>
            <li>Small pry bar</li>
            <li>Non-expandable insulation foam</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You may need additional supplies/equipment depending on the location of the window you’re installing.</p>

        <p>For instance, a window set at the top of a two-story open-concept foyer or kitchen will require scaffolding
            or extension ladders to reach. This equipment rental, plus the difficulty of using it, may be enough to make
            you reconsider your DIY dreams.</p>

        <p>It’s also important to ensure that you have enough time to complete the project. A full-frame replacement
            window takes approximately 4-6 hours to replace on the ground floor. Windows on higher stories may take
            longer to replace. Insert replacement windows typically take less time to install.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><a href=""

        </blockquote>

        <p>Lastly, it’s important to ensure that you have a plan for what you’ll do with the windows you’re replacing
            after you’ve removed them. Many household disposal sites will not take construction debris. Be sure to check
            with your local garbage disposal to confirm that they’ll be able to take your debris before starting your
            project.</p>

        <h2>Are There Any Risks to Installing Your Own Andersen Windows?</h2>

        <p>Certainly, any home improvement project can involve a level of risk.</p>

        <p>Windows are heavy, and ensuring that they are perfectly on level when installed can be difficult.</p>

        <p>Homeowners should take utmost care when cutting and handling construction materials, to ensure that they
            don’t risk injury.</p>

        <p>However, usually when homeowners ask this question, what they really want to know is:</p>

        <h2>Does Installing Andersen Windows Myself Void the Warranty?</h2>

        <p>The answer? It does not!</p>

        <p>Andersen offers a 20-year warranty for glass and a 10-year warranty for hardware regardless of who installs
            the window.</p>

        <p>However, <strong>improper installation</strong> (whether by a homeowner or a professional) may void your
            warranty. That’s why it’s critical that you feel confident in your ability to install the window properly
            before you attempt DIY installation of an Andersen window.</p>

        <h2>How to Install Andersen Windows Yourself</h2>

        <p>If you decide to proceed with doing your own installation, you’re in luck. Andersen makes it easy to install
            their windows by giving homeowners detailed, step-by-step instructions for each product they make.</p>

        <h2>1. Hinge straps</h2>

        <p>Hinge straps are a great way to add a touch of elegance to your front door. They can complement many
            architectural styles, as they are available in many finishes, shapes, and sizes.</p>

        <p>We especially love it when homeowners use the shape of hinge straps to reflect a design element in their
            home, such as a fleur de lis.</p>

        <h2>2. Clavos</h2>

        <p>Clavos are small, decorative nails that are often used in Spanish Colonial and Southwestern décor.</p>

        <p>We think that clavos look best on light-stained or painted wood doors. They create a visual border and
            usually serve to frame another design element, such as glazing (glass), a door knocker, or a wrought iron
            design embellishment.</p>

        <h2>3. Door Knockers</h2>

        <p>A door knocker is a classic way for visitors to announce themselves. There are many different styles of door
            knockers available, so you can find one that suits your taste.</p>

        <h2>4. House Numbers</h2>

        <p>Providing clear and easy-to-read house numbers is important for safety and security. It also adds visual
            interest and personalization to your entryway.</p>

        <p>You can choose from a variety of styles, colors, and materials, so you can easily find house numbers that
            match your home’s aesthetic.</p>

        <h2>5. Letterbox</h2>

        <p>A letterbox is a convenient and fun way to receive mail. In some of Raleigh’s historic neighborhoods,
            homeowners use letterboxes in lieu of mailboxes. However, even if you have a traditional mailbox at the edge
            of your property, a letterbox can add a unique flair to your front door.</p>

        <p>This vintage element is a perfect add-on to the front doors of cottages, bungalows, and craftsman-style
            homes.</p>

        <h2>6. Door Handles</h2>

        <p>Door handles are an essential part of any door, but they can also be a stylish way to add personality to your
            front door.</p>

        <p>We are also big fans of door handles that make homeowners’ lives easier. Have a scatterbrained teen who is
            constantly losing keys? Consider a handle-set with an option for key code entry. Or, if you have elderly
            family members with memory struggles, perhaps a door handle and lock set that opens by fingerprint would be
            a smart option.</p>

        <p>There are many different styles and types of door handles available, so you can find one that matches your
            taste and suits your family’s needs.</p>

        <h2>7. Peephole</h2>

        <p>A door peephole is a safety feature that allows you to see who is at your door before you open it. This can
            help to prevent unwanted visitors.</p>

        <p>A peephole also adds some visual interest to your front door. This can be a great add-on if you have a
            full-panel door with no glazing (glass).</p>

        "<p>Prefinished doors are a great option for homeowners who want a quick and easy installation process, a
            durable and long-lasting finish, and a wide variety of styles and colors to choose from.</p>

        <p>In our <a href="" /doors"">Morrisville, NC area door supply store</a>, we are finding that prefinished doors
            are more popular than ever.</p>

        <p>Here are the top 5 advantages of prefinished doors:</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest-prefinished.jpg"" alt=""
                Technician applying paint to a door panel captioned with "" Skip the DIY hassle: The top 5 advantages of
                prefinished doors"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h3>1. Quick and Easy Installation</h3>

        <p>Prefinished doors come ready to install, so you don’t have to worry about painting or staining them yourself.
        </p>

        <p>This can save you a lot of time and hassle, especially if you’re not experienced with DIY projects.</p>

        <p>For instance, with a prefinished door, there’s no worry that you’ll get paint on your brand-new hinges and
            hardware.</p>

        <p>Once the door is installed, your project is complete.</p>

        <h3>2. Professional Finish</h3>

        <p>Prefinished doors are finished by professionals in a factory setting, so you can be sure that the finish will
            be high quality and consistent.</p>

        <p>This is especially important here in central North Carolina. Between the high humidity, swirling yellow
            pollen, and surprise rain storms, there are rarely days that are truly ideal conditions to prime and paint a
            new door.</p>

        <p>By contrast, in a factory setting the paint is typically applied by spray. This means that the finish will be
            smooth with no pooling, peeling, drips, or tacky feeling.</p>

        <h3>3. Durable and Long-lasting Finish (With Great Warranties, Too!)</h3>

        <p>Prefinished doors are typically finished with a high-quality paint or stain that is resistant to scratches,
            fading, and moisture.</p>

        <p>This means that your doors will look great for years to come.</p>

        <p>Homeowners can be further assured by the excellent warranties that door manufacturers offer on their
            prefinished doors.</p>

        <p>Warranty options vary by company, but are typically anywhere from 1-5 years on the factory pre-finish.</p>

        <h3>4. No VOC Emissions</h3>

        <p>A VOC emission is the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air.</p>

        <p>VOC emissions can have several negative impacts on human health and the environment.</p>

        <p>efinished doors are typically finished with low- or zero-VOC paints and stains, which means that they are
            safe for your family and the environment.</p>

        <h3>5. Cost-effective</h3>

        <p>The cost of prefinished doors is comparable to the cost of unfinished doors.</p>

        <p>But, the convenience and time savings of them being install-ready are the real advantages of prefinished
            doors that make them a great value for smart homeowners.</p>

        "<p><strong>Why do doors cost so much?</strong> This is the top question we are asked by visitors to our <a
                href="" /doors"">Holly Springs, NC door supply store</a>.</p>

        <p>We can understand why they’re asking. Purchasing and installing a front door or patio door can be much more
            expensive than many homeowners imagine.</p>

        <p>In this article, we’ll share with you the top six reasons why doors cost so much.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pinterest-doors-cost-so-much.jpg""
                alt="" traditional brick home with a red front door and wood shutters captioned with "" Avoid the
                sticker shock: 6 reasons why doors cost so much"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>1. Customization</h2>

        <p>Exterior doors are typically built to order.</p>

        <p>Certainly, if you’re looking for a hollow-core wood panel to fit a 3-foot by 6-foot opening, you can probably
            find in-stock options at a big box store.</p>

        <p>But, most people looking to replace their home’s doors want something more than this.</p>

        <p>Most homeowners are looking for an energy-efficient front door made of durable material. Or perhaps they’re
            looking for an oversized, 8-foot entry door.</p>

        <p>They may be looking for something with a truly unique design. This might include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href=""
                    https://www.windowworksnc.com/boost-your-homes-curb-appeal-with-an-arch-top-or-round-top-front-door/"">An
                    arch-top or round-top door</a></li>
            <li><a href=""
                    https://www.windowworksnc.com/an-in-depth-guide-to-getting-an-ada-compliant-door-to-make-your-home-accessible/"">An
                    ADA-compliant door to ensure that disabled family and friends can easily enter the house</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/dutch-door/"">A door with a unique design feature, like a Dutch
                    door or a vented door.</a></li>
            <li>Unique glazing (glass) options.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This means that nothing can be ‘off the rack’. Instead, every door is made to order and uniquely crafted for
            each individual homeowner.</p>

        <p>That degree of customization is one of the reasons why doors are so expensive.</p>

        <h2>2. Cost of Materials</h2>

        <p>Your doors may be made of wood, fiberglass, aluminum, steel, or some combination of these materials.</p>

        <p>Whatever material your door is made from must be sourced. This might mean that the material is farmed or
            mined or extruded or smelted.</p>

        <p>Then, those materials must be processed by the manufacturer to meet your unique door specifications.
            Materials resourcing and production are driving factors in the cost of your new front door.</p>

        <h2>3. Cost of Glass</h2>

        <p>You may be surprised to learn that glass can be one of the biggest reasons why front doors cost so much.</p>

        <p>This is true now more than ever. That’s because nowadays double and even triple pane windows are industry
            standards. This ensures that doors are energy efficient. <a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/energy-efficient-door/"">You can read this guide to understand how to
                select an energy-efficient door.</a></p>

        <p>So, even a doors with the same size window that’s built now will require more glass than it would have in
            previous years.</p>

        <p>Additionally, to ensure that these glasses (called glazing) are energy efficient, gasses like Argon or
            Krypton are inserted between the glass panes during construction. The use of these gasses to create highly
            energy-efficient doors is another factor in the cost of new doors.</p>

        <h2>4. Shipping Costs</h2>

        <p>Though doors are generally durable, they are also large and can be extremely heavy. Most homeowners elect to
            buy a factory framed door rather than just a door panel when they are replacing their front door. The
            manufacturers must take special care to ensure that the door doesn’t become racked (or out of balance)
            during shipment.</p>

        <p>This means that manufacturers often bolster doors with wood supports to prepare them for shipment.</p>

        <p>Doors with glazing require additional packaging considerations to keep the glass intact.</p>

        <p>As you can tell, shipping doors involve a ton of packaging. It also requires significant time and manpower to
            carefully secure them inside of large freighters. Those trucks must then transport them around the country.
        </p>

        <p>The gas, supplies, and time it takes to package and ship doors is a huge driver in their cost.</p>

        <h2>5. Installation Costs</h2>

        <p>We’ve already discussed the cost of materials that go into your door. But, there are also costs associated
            with the materials that go around your doors.</p>

        <p>These are the products used to complete your installation, like caulk, nails, insulation, and moulding.</p>

        <p>It’s also true that if you are adding features like sidelights or transoms, there may be additional costs
            associated with those projects. And if you’re doing some major home reconstruction, like <a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/replacing-a-window-with-a-door-read-these-dos-and-donts-first/"">replacing
                a window with a door</a>, there can be additional fees like engineering reports.</p>

        <h2>6. Additional Construction Costs</h2>

        <p>Ever wonder what happens to your old doors after the dump trailer hauls them away?</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>That is, unless you’re reusing them for a DIY project. <a href=""
                    https://www.pinterest.com/windowworksco/diy-craft-projects-to-reuse-and-repurpose-doors/"">We have
                    lots of fun ideas for upcycling your old doors on our Pinterest page</a>.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Typically, construction materials like old doors cannot be disposed of in regular garbage dumps or even at
            some landfills. Instead, your installation crew must dispose of them at private dumps. The cost of disposing
            of your old doors is an additional reason why your new doors cost so much.</p>

            encourage homeowners to consider doors by DSA Master Crafted. Here are 5 reasons why we love DSA Master
            Crafted Doors.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pinterest-love-dsa.jpg"" alt="" interior
                of a foyer with DSA Master Crafted Doors Breezeport double door with both venting windows open""
                width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>1. DSA Master Crafted Offers an Inexpensive Mahogany Door</h2>

        <p>Mahogany doors are gorgeous and are considered top-of-the-line wood doors.</p>

        <p>Here in central North Carolina, mahogany is an especially good choice. That’s because, unlike some other
            species of wood, mahogany can stand up to the Carolina heat, humidity, and temperature swings without
            experiencing tremendous swelling or shrinking.</p>

        <p>There are many varieties of mahogany, and red mahogany is what’s commonly used to make doors.</p>

        <p>DSA, however, uses white mahogany to make their mahogany doors. White mahogany is a less expensive type of
            mahogany that delivers all the benefits of the costlier red variety. If you’re worried that white mahogany
            may not deliver the visual impact you’re looking for from mahogany, never fear. After staining the door, it
            is impossible to tell that it isn’t a red mahogany variety.</p>

        <h2>2. DSA Master Crafted is a Raleigh-based Door Company</h2>

        <p>As a Triangle-based family business, we at Window Works love to connect our customers with other local
            businesses.</p>

        <p>Especially when those businesses are as obsessed with quality and value as we are.</p>

        <h2>3. DSA Master Crafted Offer Customization Options That Complement Every Architectural Style</h2>

        <p>Maybe you need a <a href=""

                top door with iron clavos</a> to enhance the old-world charm of your Tudor cottage.</p>

            up the clean-lines aesthetic of your contemporary home.</p>

        <p>No matter what you’re looking for, DSA offers a stunning array of customization options. This makes their
            doors a great choice for every architectural style of home imaginable.</p>

        <h2>Glass Selection</h2>

        <p>DSA Mastercrafted Doors offers many great options for decorative and privacy glass.</p>

        <p>We are especially partial to the clear beveled option that DSA offers on doors. This unfussy yet elegant
            design element can make even the most standard doors look really special.</p>

        <h2>DSA Makes The Breezeport</h2>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/dutch-door/"">We’ve written before about how much we love the
                versatility of the eye-catching Breezeport door.</a> A functional alternative to trendy (but often
            impractical) Dutch Doors, the Breezeport door is a solidly built showstopper. The door features a unique
            venting window.</p>

        "<p>Homeowners who visit our<a href="" /doors""> Cary, NC door showroom</a> are sometimes hesitant to consider
            patio doors with built-in blinds.</p>

        <p>But, after they learn all of the hidden benefits of patio doors with blinds between the glass, they are often
            convinced that these doors will be perfect for their homes.</p>

        <p>Read on to learn our top three reasons to love patio doors with built-in blinds. We bet you’ll be convinced,
            too!</p>

        <p><img src=""

                width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>Patio Door Built-in Blinds are Safer</h2>

        <p><a href="" http://business.cch.com/plsd/AAPWindowCoverings12-11-17.pdf"">This 2018 study in the journal
                Pediatrics notes that external window blinds have been responsible for thousands of injuries to children
                in the past several decades</a>. Sadly, window blind cords have also caused hundreds of deaths,
            especially in children 6 years old and younger.</p>

        <p>Because most built-in blinds on patio doors are cordless, they eliminate this safety risk completely.</p>

        <p>When we are helping parents or grandparents of young children find new patio doors, we always encourage them
            to consider built-in blinds for this reason.</p>

        <p>The same is true for pet owners. Owners of new puppies and cats of all ages appreciate knowing that their pet
            can’t be hurt by chewing on dangling blind cords.</p>

        <h2>Patio Door Built-in Blinds are Easier to Clean</h2>

        <p>With built-in blinds, you never have to worry about dusting each individual vane as you do with Venetian
            blinds.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Vane is the technical term for the individual horizontal pieces which make up a set of blinds.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Because the blinds are encased in the door’s glass, they don’t become dusty or grimy over time.</p>

        <p>This gives you all the functionality of patio door blinds, without the cumbersome cleaning commitments.</p>

        <h2>Patio Door Built-in Blinds are Less likely to Break than External Blinds</h2>

        <p>External blinds can be…prissy.</p>

        <p>Kids and pets can easily destroy them. Even just twisting them too tightly or in the wrong direction can
            render them useless. Whether they become stuck or saggy, or bent or bowed, eventually it seems that most
            external blinds break down. They become unsightly and worse, they stop working properly.</p>

        <p>Patio door built-in blinds, on the other hand, are protected from damage. Their controls are usually
            magnetized or mechanical rather than manual. This saves them from accidental damage due to user error.</p>

        <p>What this means for homeowners is much less time spent fiddling with blinds, trying to make them look and
            work right.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>When you’re looking for new patio doors, you want to work with professionals who can guide you through the
            options that will make your home beautiful, safe, and care-free.</p>

        <h2>Arch-Top Front Doors</h2>

        <p>Also called an eyebrow arch, an arch top front door features a gentle curve that clearly separates at a given
            point from the vertical lines of the sides of the door panel.</p>

        <p>Arch-top front doors may be single or double doors. They may be accented by sidelites or may have glazing
            (glass) in the door panel or panels. Transoms are rarely seen above arch-top doors.</p>

        <h4>What Style of Home Looks Best with an Arch-top Front Door?</h4>

        <p>Arch-top front doors can complement many home styles. Traditional, colonial, and Craftsman-style homes look
            especially great with arch-top front doors.</p>

        <h3>Round-Top Front Doors</h3>

        <p>Rarer than arch-top front doors are round-top front doors. In a true round-top front door, the top of the
            door is a semicircle that extends upward from the sides of the door.</p>

        <p>There is no clear distinction between the sides of the door and the arch at the top. Rather, the line is
            seamless. They may also be called full radius doors.</p>

        <p>True round-top front doors are typically seen as single doors. However, it is possible to have a true
            round-top double door.</p>

        <p>While you technically could accent them with sidelites or a transom, this is rarely seen.</p>

        <p>Aesthetically, a round-top front door is an impactful design choice, that usually looks best when the
            surrounding elements are simple and unfussy. This allows the door to be a true focal point in your home’s
            curb appeal.</p>

        <h4>What Style of Home Looks Best with a Round-top Front Door?</h4>

        <p>Round-top front doors look best on traditional homes with old-world-inspired architecture.</p>

        <p>Mediterranean villas, cottages with storybook charm, and French country estates are just some of the
            architectural styles that look incredible with round top front doors.</p>

        <p>The uniqueness of round top front doors may be further accentuated with stained-glass features. Or homeowners
            may use hardware details like clavos and strap hinges to amp up the charm.</p>

        <p>Pictured below, clavos are decorative nails that can be added to wooden doors to add visual interest.</p>

        <h2>Common Questions About Arch-top and Round-top Front Doors</h2>

        <h3>What Materials are Arch-top and Round-top Front Doors Made From?</h3>

        <p>Both styles of front door are made from the same materials as typical rectangular front doors.</p>

        <p>Arch-top front doors are commonly made from wood or fiberglass. Round-top front doors will typically be made
            from wood, though it is possible to get them in fiberglass.</p>

        <h3>Do Arch-top and Round-top Front Doors Require More Maintenance than Rectangular Doors?</h3>

        <p>All front doors require regular maintenance to keep them looking and functioning beautifully. Arch-top and
            round-top front doors require no more maintenance than their rectangular counterparts.</p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/the-only-exterior-door-maintenance-checklist-youll-ever-need/"">Be
                sure to read this post for a comprehensive guide to front door maintenance. It includes a free,
                printable checklist you can use to ensure that your front door looks and works great year after
                year.</a></p>

        <h3>Are Arch-top and Round-top Front Doors More Expensive than Rectangular Doors?</h3>

        <p>The answer to this question, unfortunately, is “definitely, yes.”</p>

        <p>How much more expensive an arch-top or round-top front door will be than a rectangular door will depend on
            several factors, including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The material the door is made of (with wood doors costing more than fiberglass)</li>
            <li>Whether it’s a single or double-door</li>
            <li>The amount of glazing (glass) in the door</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It’s also important to note that installation of an arch-top or round-top front door will cost more than
            installing a rectangular door. That’s because of the craftsmanship required to cut and frame the curved
            feature of the door. Additionally, curved or rounded trim will cost more than straight trim.</p>

        <h3>Can I replace a Rectangular Door with an Arch-top and Round-top Front Door?</h3>

        <p>Technically, yes, it is possible to replace a rectangular door with an arch-top or round top front door.</p>

        <p>In practice, though, this is rarely done. That’s because the construction costs associated with changing the
            framing of the door to achieve the curve are generally cost-prohibitive. This is especially true if there is
            stonework or masonry around the door.</p>

        <h2>Alternatives to Arch-top and Round-top Front Doors: Mimic the Look with Transoms or Glazing</h2>

        <p>So, what can you do if you love the look of an arched or round door, but the cost puts this style out of
            reach?</p>

        <p>Luckily, there are options for you.</p>

        <p>There are several ways that you can mimic the look of a rounded or arch-top front door without committing to
            a rounded door frame.</p>

        <p>One way is to install an arched or semi-circular transom light over your front door. This kind of transom can
            be applied to either a single or a double door.</p>

        <p>Another option is to select a front door that has arched glass features, or glazing.</p>

        <p>Arched glazing can give you the visual impact of an arch-top front door, without the cost and additional
            construction hassles.</p>

        "<p>When you upgrade your front door, you’ll also need to consider if you want to change out of your sidelights
            and transoms.</p>

        <p>Sidelights are the slim windows on either side of a front door. A transom is the small window above it.</p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/doors/"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">Here at Window Works
                Co., we help Morrisville, NC homeowners who want to update their front doors with sidelights and
                transoms that reflect their style.</a></p>

        <p>Many homeowners feel that their sidelights and transoms are dated and stale. They wonder “Are there any
            sidelight and transom trends that can increase my home’s curb appeal?”</p>

        <p>In this post, we’re sharing the top three sidelight and transom upgrades. These changes will complement your
            front door and make your home look amazing.</p>

                unexpected ways to freshen up sidelights and transoms"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>Ditch the Grilles</h2>

        <p>Here in Wake County, many homes built in the 1980s and 1990s featured 6-over-6 grille patterns in double-hung
            windows.</p>

        <p>To complement this, sidelights on the homes built in this era also commonly featured grilles.</p>

        <p>Of course, sidelights could feature other grille patterns as well.</p>

        <p>Now, however, many homeowners are choosing to ditch the grilles, for a decidedly modern look.</p>

        <p>When it comes time to update your sidelights, consider if going sans grilles could be just the change you
            need. It’s a small difference with a big impact.</p>

        <h2>Embrace Asymmetry</h2>

        <p>Another option would be to reconfigure your door so that you have a sidelight only on one side. Executed with
            the right materials, this unexpected look can especially complement the contemporary architectural style.
        </p>

        <h2>Go For An Arched Transom</h2>

        <p>Finally, when it comes to your transom, you may want to consider an arched or half-circle window. This small
            change can add loads of visual interest to your front door.</p>

        "<p>If you’re building a home in the Raleigh, NC area, you are likely already planning to purchase
            energy-efficient windows for your new home.</p>

        <p>But, there’s one important fact that you need to check before selecting which energy-efficient windows to use
            in your home.</p>

        <p>This is the key information that we encourage all home builders visiting our <a href="" /windows"">Raleigh,
                NC window showroom</a> to know before ordering new energy-efficient windows.</p>

        <p><img src=""

        <h2>Choosing Energy-Efficient Windows for Your New Home</h2>

        <p>If you’re building a new home, it makes sense that you want energy-efficient windows. <a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/energy-efficient-windows/"">A</a><a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/energy-efficient-windows/"">s we explain in this post, energy-efficient
                windows can save you money and protect your home from the elements</a>. The ENERGY STAR designation is a
            quick way to confirm if windows meet the criteria to qualify as ‘energy efficient’.</p>

        <p>ENERGY STAR is a program run by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
            The program promotes energy efficiency by labeling a wide range of products as meeting ENERGY STAR
            requirements.</p>

        <p>In addition to doors, windows, and skylights, ENERGY STAR rates household appliances, computers, lightbulbs,
            and more.</p>

        <p>A product having an ENERGY STAR certification means that it meets a minimum standard of energy efficiency. <a
                href="" https://www.energystar.gov/products/res_windows_doors_skylights"">An ENERGY STAR certification
                indicates that a window:</a></p>

        <ul>
            <li>is manufactured by an ENERGY STAR partner,</li>
            <li>is independently tested, certified, and verified by the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC), and
            </li>
            <li>has NFRC ratings that meet strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the US Environmental Protection
                Agency (EPA).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ensuring that Your New Energy Efficient Windows Also Meet Local Building Code Guidelines</h2>

        <p>You may think that simply choosing any window that meets ENERGY STAR standards will suffice for your new
            home. However, if you’re building a new home, it’s important that you <strong>check the local building codes
                governing your project.</strong></p>

        <p>More and more frequently, we are seeing <strong>local building codes</strong> whose requirements for energy
            efficiency are <strong>more stringent than</strong> what is required to meet <strong>ENERGY STAR
                standards</strong>.</p>

        <p>And because windows are generally custom-made, they are typically a ‘No Returns’ product.</p>

        <p>This means that it’s critical that you ensure that the specific window you’re purchasing meets energy code
            standards <strong>and</strong> that it meets the local building code standards for your area. Otherwise, you
            may order a whole houseful of windows that you can’t install in your new home.</p>

        <p>At <a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/"">Window Works Co.</a>, we know that building a new home is

        "<p>When replacing your home’s windows, it’s important that you have all the right information. There are some
            rookie assumptions to avoid when replacing your home’s windows.</p>

        <p>Today we’re sharing with you the top three assumptions that we hear homeowners make about window replacement
            in our <a href="" /windows"">Morrisville, NC window showroom</a>.</p>

        <h2>Why it Matters That You Not Make These Rookie Assumptions When Replacing your Home’s Windows</h2>

        <p>Here at Window Works Co., we know that homeowners are happy when they find the windows they truly love.</p>

            these inaccurate assumptions as an easy target for over-selling.</p>

        <h2>The Top 3 Rookie Assumptions to Avoid when Replacing your Home’s Windows</h2>

        <h3>1. That you have Andersen Windows</h3>

        <p>Many homeowners believe that they have Andersen windows. Some believe this just because the Andersen brand is
            so synonymous with windows. Others think they have Andersen windows because that’s what was reported when
            they bought their home.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, many of these homeowners later learn that they don’t, in fact, have Andersen windows.</p>

        <p>Luckily for you, you can <a href="" /do-i-have-andersen-windows-how-to-find-out-in-under-a-minute"">read this
                quick article to find out if you have Andersen windows in under a minute.</a></p>

        <h3>2. That you Have Custom Moulding</h3>

        <p>Sometimes, homeowners will call us to get a quote on replacement windows and will mention offhandedly that
            their windows have custom casing (or moulding) around them. They want to know how much it will cost for us
            to replicate the profile of their unique moulding.</p>

        <p>Usually, when we visit their home to measure their windows, we see that they have standard mouldings. While
            it may be a profile that you’ve not seen before, there are many varieties of mouldings that are actually
            standard. Moulding #445 is one that homeowners frequently believe is custom to their home, but that is
            actually a standard casing.</p>

        <p>Homeowners are usually glad to find out that they were mistaken about this. They’re relieved to learn that
            they’ll be able to get their same mouldings replaced without extra cost or hassle.</p>

        <h3>3. That your Wood Windows are Custom Sizes</h3>

        <p>The final assumption that you might make when replacing your home’s windows has to do with their size.</p>

        <p>Here in the Morrisville, NC area, many homeowners are replacing the builder-grade, wood windows that were
            original to their homes in the 1980s and 1990s. But, these homeowners will often tell us that they have
            ‘custom size’ windows.</p>

        <p>What you should know is that wood window sizes in America have been fairly standard since the early 1800’s.
        </p>

        <p>If you’re a window nerd like us, you can read this article, “<a href=""
                https://www.jstor.org/stable/1494065"">A Technical History of Late Nineteenth Century Windows in the
                United States</a>“, to learn more about how advances in glassmaking and manufacturing made it possible
            to standardize window sizes in the 1830s.</p>

        <p>So, even in custom homes, it’s very likely that wood windows are standard sizes. Again, this is a relief to
            most homeowners. It means that replacing your home’s windows with a fiberglass or composite upgrade will be
            relatively straightforward.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>We hope that it’s helpful for you to know these common mistaken assumptions that newbies may make when
            replacing their home’s windows. Knowing them can help you make the best replacement decision for your home’s
            windows.</p>

        "<h2>What Exactly Will Happen During a Window Measurement and Consultation Appointment?</h2>

        <p>If you have a professional coming to your home to measure for replacement windows, you may have questions
            about what will happen.</p>

        <p>In our <a href="" /windows"">Raleigh, NC window store</a>, some of the common questions customers have before
            a measurement appointment are:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“Does someone measuring my home for replacement windows need to come inside the house? Or can they just
                measure from the outside?”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“How long will it take to measure my home for new windows?”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“Do I need to know what kind of new windows I want when my old windows are measured?”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Read on to learn the answers to these questions and more about what you can expect during a window
            measurement and consultation appointment.</p>

        <p><img src=""

                1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h3>1. Do I need to have a Professional Measure my Windows?</h3>

        <p>First, we need to address the top question we get about in-home window measurement and consultation
            appointments. That is ‘<strong>Do I even need to have a professional come to my home and measure for
                replacement windows</strong>?’</p>

        <p>We can understand why you’re asking.</p>

        <p>The internet is full of advice about how to measure for replacement windows. With so much information
            available, it seems like measuring your own windows for replacement should be easy enough for the average
            homeowner to do, right?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, no.</p>

        <p>We have seen self-measurement end up terribly for homeowners.</p>

        <p>That’s because window measurement is complicated.</p>

        <p>Which exterior casing profile is needed? What about the interior moulding profile? Are extension jambs
            needed, and if so, in what size?</p>

        <p>These are just some of the questions that an experienced window consultant will need to find answers to while
            measuring your home. As you can see, it’s much more in-depth than simply knowing the length and width of
            your windows.</p>

        <p>We also know that homeowners who measure for replacement windows themselves risk losing a lot of money.</p>

        <p>Suppose you order a whole houseful of windows only to realize that all or even some of them are the wrong
            size. There is no way to return these windows. <a href=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/why-are-windows-so-expensive/"">That’s because windows are, in most cases,
                made to order to the unique size, color, and material specifications that each homeowner wants</a>.</p>

        <p>This mistake could cost you thousands of dollars, and result in lengthy construction delays while waiting for
            the right size windows.</p>

        <p>That’s why we insist on personally measuring the windows for every homeowner we sell to.</p>

        <h3>2. Will the Person Measuring my Replacement Windows Need to come Inside my Home? Or can They Measure
            Everything from the Outside?</h3>

        <p>As we just described, properly measuring your windows for replacement involves assessing much more than the
            length and width of your windows. For your window quote to be accurate, the consultant will need access to
            the inside of your home.</p>

        <p>It’s also important for the window consultant to come inside your home to make other assessments.</p>

        <p>Suppose, for example, they note signs of rot in the walls below your windows. Seeing this ahead of time, they
            can give you a more accurate assessment of the cost to repair this during the installation of your
            replacement windows.</p>

        <p>Had they only seen the outside of your home, that rot repair would be an unexpected cost and construction
            delay during your window replacement project.</p>

        <h3>3. Does Someone Measuring my Windows need to see Every Room in my House?</h3>

        <p>In short, yes.</p>

        <p>It happens frequently that a homeowner tells us they have, say, 14 windows for replacement. But, when we come
            to their home to measure, we find 15, 16, or even 17 windows!</p>

        <p>It’s easy to forget about windows hidden in tucked away rooms like bathrooms, laundry rooms, even closets!
        </p>

        <p>A window measurement consultant is not trying to invade your privacy if they ask you to look inside a room or
            behind a door.</p>

        <p>They are just trying to ensure that every window in your home is measured for replacement so that nothing is
            missed.</p>

        <h3>4. I had my Windows Measured for an Estimate a Few Years Ago. Can you just use those Measurements?”</h3>

        <p>At <a href="" https://www.windowworksnc.com/"">Window Works Co.</a>, our policy is that we always remeasure
            if it’s been 6 months or longer since we’ve been to your property.</p>

        <p>Of course, we’re not expecting the sizes of your windows to change. But we do want to make sure that we have
            the most up-to-date information about the condition of your windows and walls. This will help us to give you
            the most accurate quote for windows and installation.</p>

        <p>As we always say, it’s better to measure twice and cut once!</p>

        <h3>5. Will I get my Quote for the Cost of Replacement Windows During the Window Measurement and Consultation
            Appointment?</h3>

        <p>We understand and want to know as soon as possible how much window replacement will cost.</p>

        <p>However, because each window is custom made for your home and design specification, each window must be
            individually quoted.</p>

        <p>In addition, the cost for installation labor must be individually calculated based on your home. As an
            example of why this is true; suppose two homeowners have a window roughly the same size and color to be
            installed. The installation cost may be very different if one homeowner is having this window installed on
            the ground floor, and the other is having it installed above a second story foyer. This second homeowner’s
            window will require scaffolding to access and additional installation personnel for safety reasons, and thus
            the same window may cost more to install.</p>

        <p>Finally, allowing time for quoting can let us show you the cost difference between multiple options.</p>

        <p>Maybe you aren’t sure if you’d like a vinyl or a fiberglass window. Or perhaps you’d like to see how much
            more black windows would cost than white.</p>

        <p>Just know that all of these options can be quoted, but that it may take some for each window you’re
            considering to be quoted. We ask that you allow us up to one week from the time we measure to deliver your
            quote for replacement windows.</p>

        <h3>6. How Long Does a Window Measurement and Consultation Appointment Last?</h3>

        <p>This will, of course, vary depending on many windows you have in your home, and how easy they are for the
            measurement consultant to access.</p>

        <p>However, a rough estimate is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>5-10 windows may take 15-30 minutes</li>
            <li>10-15 windows may take 30-45 minutes</li>
            <li>15-20 windows may take 45-60  minutes</li>
            <li>20+ windows may take an hour or more</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quick Checklist to get Ready for your Window Measurement and Consultation Appointment</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Make sure every window is accessible. This may mean moving furniture or stored items if they prevent
                someone from accessing a window.</li>
            <li>Count the windows in your home. We recommend you do this from the inside and the outside, to be sure
                that the numbers match!</li>
            <li>If you are completing your project in multiple phases, we recommend marking your windows to make clear
                which should be measured and which should not.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Pro tip: Painter’s tape with a note written such as ‘include’ or ‘don’t include’ works great for this!</p>

        "<p>Many homeowners who visit our <a href="" /windows"">Holly Springs, NC window supply store</a> want to
            achieve a modern style with their new windows. Recently, black windows have been the favored choice for
            homeowners who want a contemporary look. However, some homeowners want a modern style with more natural
            finishes. For those homeowners, we love to recommend Japandi-style windows.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pinterest-japandi-style-windows.jpg""

                essential design elements: How to achieve modern Japandi style with your windows"""" width="" 1000""
                height="" 1500""></p>

        <p>If you aren’t familiar with the Japandi style, it’s a modern mix of Japanese and Scandinavian design
            elements. <a href="" https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/japandi-style-101"">As this article explains
                in more detail, this aesthetic celebrates organic materials, minimalist design, and functionality.</a>
        </p>

        <p>Japandi style emphasizes connection to nature, finding beauty in what is simple, and permeating warmth.</p>

        <p>Your home’s windows are the bridge from your interior to the natural elements outside. If you love this
            aesthetic, Japandi-style windows make sense to connect your home to the outdoors.</p>

        <p>Of course, you may be wondering, can a wood window really be contemporary? How do you keep a wood window from
            looking outdated, overly traditional, and stale?</p>

        <h2>What Features Make Japandi-Style Windows Modern?</h2>

        <p>There are several key design features that will ensure that your windows are modern and fresh.</p>

        <h3>Frame size</h3>

        <p>To keep your new wood windows looking contemporary, you want a style that accentuates the glass. You can
            accomplish this by choosing a window profile that has thin frames.</p>

        <h3>Installation</h3>

        <p>Furthering the modern look, opt for drywall returns in your installation.</p>

        <p>In this window installation method, the window is installed without any trim or casing framing it.</p>

        <p>This keeps your window’s profile ultra-thin.</p>

        <h3>Grille Size and Pattern</h3>

        <p>It’s important to choose grilles that match your modern window frames. This means that your grilles should be
            delicate and thin.</p>

        <p>As a general rule, the more divided glass panes you have, the more traditional a window will appear. If your
            goal is to achieve a contemporary look, we recommend you choose windows that have no more than a two over
            two arrangement if you have a single or double-hung window.</p>

        <p>Or, you can opt for a unique grille pattern, such as the uneven prairie pattern featured in the picture
            above.</p>

        <p>Of course, a picture window (one that has no grilles diving the glass) would be great choice, too.</p>

        <h3>Finish</h3>

        <p>We predict that white oak finish will be the next big thing in window design. This neutral wood finish is a
            perfect embodiment of the Japanese style.</p>

        <h3>Size of the Window</h3>

        <p>Finally, sizing is another feature that can make a wood window distinctively modern.</p>

        <p>Opting for large sized windows is another hallmark of contemporary design.</p>

        <p>This is usually done to match the scale of dramatically high-pitched roofs and expansive open floor plans.

        "<p>If you’re like most of the homeowners we talk to in our<a href="" /windows"" target="" _blank"" rel=""
                noopener""> Cary, NC window store</a>, you spent a lot of time researching replacement windows. You may
            have noted that the window you purchased offered a 10-year, 20-year, or even a lifetime* warranty. For most
            homeowners, their thoughts about their window warranty stop there.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>*Note that this usually means ‘for the understood lifetime of a window’; we’ve seen Lifetime mean as
                little as three years of coverage!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>What you may not know is that many common practices may void your window warranty.</p>

        <p>In this post, we’re sharing the top 5 things that homeowners do that inadvertently void the coverage on their
            residential windows.</p>

        <p>Of course, this post is intended as general advice. You should review your windows’ manufacturer’s warranty
            to confirm what is and is not allowable in your unique case.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pinterest-window-warranty-683x1024.jpg""
                alt="" kitchen nook with a blue countertop and large white picture windows captioned with "" STOP! These
                5 common practices will void the warranty on your new windows"""" width="" 683"" height="" 1024""></p>

        <h2>Power-washing your Windows</h2>

        <p>Many top window brands expressly state that pressure washing or power washing windows will void the warranty
            on new windows. Other brands can be a little tricky. Their warranties explain how you should clean the
            window. Their implicit assumption is that you understand that cleaning it any other way will void the
            warranty.</p>

        <p>We’ve known many homeowners who’ve been offhandedly asked “When was the last time you pressure washed the
            windows?” as part of their warranty claim submission.</p>

        <p>Our advice is that you stick to washing your windows exactly as outlined in your warranty. Doing anything
            else puts you at risk of not being able to make a claim should your windows ever fail during the lifetime of
            the warranty.</p>

        <h2>Putting Security or Privacy Film on your Windows</h2>

        <p>Many homeowners will apply films to their windows for a variety of reasons. Security, light reduction, and
            privacy films are just some of the products we’ve seen.
            Usually, the application of these films requires removing the seal on a window, and that practice voids the
            warranty on most major window brands.</p>

        <p>Rather than plan to apply a film, we encourage homeowners to research energy-efficient glass, privacy glass,
            and other options. That way, they won’t need to worry about adding anything to their new windows that might
            void the warranty.</p>

        <h2>Not Having your Windows Installed Properly</h2>

        <p>Every window warranty we’ve ever read makes this point clear. The manufacturer will not cover product issues
            that result from poor installation.</p>

        <p>Many homeowners believe that they will save money by installing their windows themselves. Or, they hire less
            experienced handyman-types to install them, rather than hire window installers.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, these homeowners are usually not considering the high cost they’ll incur if their windows fail
            because of poor installation, and they aren’t covered by warranty as a result.</p>

        <h2>Living Within 5 Miles of a Body of Water</h2>

        <p>We know that this one is probably out of your control, but we like to make our customers aware that some
            window warranties are void if you live near water. The usual distance we see is within 5 miles of a body of
            water.</p>

        <p>While you may not be able to control how close your home is to the nearest body of water, it can still be
            helpful to know this.</p>

        <p>Say, for example, you are comparing two window brands that both include this exclusion, but one has a longer
            warranty term.</p>

        <p>It would not make sense to pay more for an otherwise comparable window just because it has a longer warranty,
            if you know that your property will likely be excluded.</p>

        <h2>Moving</h2>

        <p>Lastly, you should know that many window warranties are not transferable. This means that the protection does
            not transfer to a new homeowner if the homeowner who bought the windows sells the home.</p>

        <p>Again, while it may be outside of your control, it can be helpful to know this information. Say, for
            instance, you are purchasing a home and the sellers installed new windows three years ago.</p>

        <p>If they have a 20-year warranty, you may assume that you have 17 years of coverage left in the event that the
            windows show signs of failure.</p>

        <p>Be sure to check, though, if the warranty is transferable. If it’s not, it’s the same as the window being out
            of warranty.</p>

        <p>Pocket or Full-Frame? Vinyl or Composite? What U-Factor do you need? Awning or Casement?</p>

        <p>Overwhelmed yet?</p>

        <p>Smart homeowners want to learn only the things they need to know to find the right window for them. They
            don’t want to waste time, for example, <a href="" /andersen-window-series-an-in-depth-product-comparison""

                1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>1. Know what Kind of Replacement you Want</h2>

        <p>Many homeowners begin researching replacement windows by thinking about the style of window they want. Do
            they want to stick with white, or would black windows be better?</p>

        <p>Should they keep the same prairie grilles, or maybe switch up to a picture window to maximize the view?</p>

        <p>But, before you start daydreaming about how your windows will look, we encourage you to first think about how
            they will be installed.</p>

        <p>The first step you should take when researching new windows is to <a href=""
                /full-frame-or-pocket-insert-replacement-windows/"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">decide if you
                want a full frame replacement or an insert replacement</a>.</p>

        <p>Knowing this will save you time when it comes to researching your replacement window options.</p>

        <p>For instance, suppose you have the suspicion that water has leaked into your walls between your windows. You
            know that part of the window replacement project will involve repairing this rot. It may not make sense to
            consider an insert replacement because with this type of installation rot and repair work can be more costly
            than it would be in a full-frame replacement. Thus, you would know off the bat that <a href=""
                /andersen-versus-renewal-by-andersen-windows"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">Renewal by Andersen,
                which only offers an insert replacement window</a>, would not be an option for you.</p>

        <p>This is one relatively quick decision to make that will save you lots of time when evaluating replacement
            windows.</p>

        <h2>2. Consider the Energy Efficiency You Want in your Replacement Windows</h2>

        <p>Many people assume that a window either is or is not energy efficient, but they are missing an important
            factor. Namely, where they live. Energy efficiency ratings are based on climate. It’s important to consider
            the climate zone you live in and to determine the energy efficiency ratings you are looking for in a few key
            areas. These include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>U-factor</li>
            <li>Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)</li>
            <li>Visible Transmittance</li>
        </ul>

        <p><a href="" /energy-efficient-windows"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">Our guide to window energy
                efficiency ratings outlines in detail what each of these ratings indicate, and what to look for based on
                your climate.</a></p>

        <p>Knowing the energy efficiency ratings you’re looking for can make it very easy to quickly compare possible
            windows and assess whether they will meet your needs.</p>

        <h2>3. Identify the Materials you Want your Windows Made From</h2>

        <p>Windows can be made from a variety of materials. They may be wood, aluminum, fiberglass, composite, or vinyl.
        </p>

        <p>Fiberglass, composite, and aluminum windows fare the best long-term against our North Carolina heat and
            humidity. These are the most durable products, and they have a price tag that reflects this.</p>

        <p>Wood, on the other hand, maybe more prone to rot, warp, and other functioning issues over time. But, wood
            windows generally cost less than the more indestructible options.</p>

        <p>A reputable window supplier will help you consider the factors unique to your home that may factor into this
            decision. For instance, suppose your windows are all protected by overhangs or shade from trees. A vinyl or
            wood window may be more durable in your home than it would be if your windows were exposed to full sunlight.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Now it’s Time to Choose the Style of Window You Want</h2>

        <p>Finally, it’s time to revisit the step that most homeowners think of first. Consider the style of window you
            want.</p>

        <p>Do you want a casement window that cranks open or a sliding window that glides side to side? What color do
            you want for the exterior of your windows?</p>

        <p>Here again, making these decisions can help you narrow down the brand of windows you will consider. Suppose
            you know you want a black vinyl window. <a href="" https://www.provia.com/windows/"" target="" _blank""
                rel="" noopener"">Provia makes a gorgeous black, vinyl window</a>, whereas many other vinyl window
            suppliers only carry white windows. Thus, you have again narrowed down the options you will have to compare,
            saving you valuable research time.</p>

        <h2>5. Finally, it’s Time to Research Window Brands</h2>

        <p>Only after taking these four steps should you start to research window brands.</p>

        <p>Armed with critical knowledge about the replacement type, energy efficiency, materials, and style you’re
            looking for, you will save yourself tons of time.</p>

        <h3>There are Three Ways to Research Replacement Windows</h3>

        <h4>1. Using General Online Evaluators</h4>

                _blank"" rel="" noopener"">Consumer Reports</a> is a familiar option to many homeowners, who trust their
            evaluations and recommendations.</p>

        <h4>2. Using Window Brands’ Comparison Tools</h4>

        <p>Most window companies have tools available to homeowners that allow for quick comparisons of products. <a

        <h3>3. Visiting a Window Showroom</h3>

        <p>We cannot stress enough how critical we think it is to visit a window showroom and spend time seeing,
            touching, and moving the window you’re considering.</p>

        <p>Countless times customers have realized the importance of certain features only by visiting our showroom and
            experiencing those features firsthand. As just one example, we helped one couple who were convinced that
            they wanted a 6 over 6 grille pattern to mimic the look of the windows they were replacing. That is until
            they visited our window showroom and saw up close what a no-grille option looked like. They knew instantly
            that they would enjoy their morning coffee much more having a no grilles breaking up their view of their
            garden.</p>

        <p>We recently chatted with Katherine MacPhail of the Talking Home Renovations podcast about why it is so
            helpful for customers to spend time in a showroom. <a href=""

        <h2>Insert Window Replacement</h2>

        <p>In an insert window replacement, installers remove the sash and hardware of your existing window. They then
            install a new window within the existing window frame. The resulting window will have less glass area.</p>

        <h3>Other Names for Insert Window Replacement:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Insert window replacement</li>
            <li>Pocket window replacement</li>
            <li>Frame-in-frame replacement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What’s Removed During Insert Window Replacement?</h3>

        <p>The old sashes and hardware are the only parts of the existing window removed.</p>

        <h3>What’s Retained During Insert Window Replacement?</h3>

        <p>The existing window frame and interior and exterior trim (casing) remain in place during an insert window
            replacement.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Insert Window Replacement</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>This option is generally less expensive and less time-consuming than a full frame replacement.</li>
            <li>Pocket replacement preserves existing interior and exterior trim. This may be important if you have
                custom trim work.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations of Insert Window Replacement</h3>

        <p>Because the existing frame is not removed, there may be additional costs associated with assessing for any
            rot or other issues in the walls around your window. That’s because your window installation team does not
            have as much access to the wall area during an insert window replacement.</p>

        <p>Nor can they make any adjustments to the existing window frame, including shimming, re-insulating, etc.
            without removing your exterior casing.</p>

        <p>The resulting window will be smaller than the current window. Thus, it may not make sense to do pocket window
            replacements for very small windows.</p>

        <h3>Insert Window Replacement is Best Suited for:</h3>

        <p>This type of replacement is ideal for medium to large-sized windows with structurally sound frames. Put
            another way, windows with no energy efficiency or moisture/leakage concerns.</p>

        <p>Pocket insert replacement is an option for all styles of windows, including casements, picture windows, and
            double-hung windows.</p>

        <p>Here in central North Carolina, we typically perform these replacements on older wood windows.</p>

        <h3>Insert Window Replacement is Not Suited for:</h3>

        <p>Older windows where homeowners suspect rot. Or, windows showing signs of malfunction or warping.  Very small
            windows (such as dormer windows) where a smaller glass area would look wrong.</p>

        <h2>Full Frame Window Replacement</h2>

        <p>During a full frame replacement, the entire existing window is removed and replaced with an all-new window.
            First, window installers completely remove the existing window and trim. This creates a rough opening down
            to the wall studs. Finally, a completely new window is installed.</p>

        <h3>Other Names for Full Frame Window Replacement:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Total tear out</li>
            <li>Complete replacement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What’s Removed During Full Frame Window Replacement?</h3>

        <p>The installation crew first removes the entire existing window. This includes removing all casing (moulding)
            and framing. The crew may also remove some exterior siding, especially if they are replacing the window with
            a larger window.</p>

        <h3>What’s Retained During Full Frame Window Replacement?</h3>

        <p>Nothing of the original window remains during a full-frame window replacement. All materials used in the
            window replacement are new.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Full Frame Window Replacement</h3>

        <p>Full frame window replacement allows homeowners to change the size, color, and type of windows they have. For
            instance, you can easily swap out a small, white, single-hung window for a large, black, picture window
            during a full frame replacement.</p>

        <p>Full frame replacement also allows your installation team to make your new windows as energy-efficient as
            possible. This includes shimming the windows into place, as well as adding additional insulation around your
            new windows.</p>

        <p>Finally, full frame replacement allows you to choose a rot-resistant material for your window exterior. That
            way, you never have to worry about your windows rotting after you’ve replaced them.</p>

        <h3>Limitations of Full Frame Window Replacement</h3>

        <p>This option is generally more expensive than a pocket window replacement. The additional materials and labor
            needed for proper installation are what drive this increase in price.</p>

        <p>A full-frame window replacement will also generally take more time to complete. That’s because it takes more
            time to properly set the window in place. This includes insulating the window and shimming it to ensure that
            it is plum, level, and square. This method also requires the new application of any brickmould, interior
            mouldings, etc. that the homeowner wants around the window frame.</p>

        <h3>Full Frame Window Replacement is Best Suited for:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Windows with known or suspected rot issues.</li>
            <li>Windows that aren’t functioning properly, or that are older and breaking down.</li>
            <li>Homeowners who want to change the look of their windows (different window styles, sizes, colors,
                materials, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Full Frame Window Replacement is Not Suited for:</h3>

        <p>There are no conditions when a full-frame window replacement would not be a suitable option.</p>

        "<p>Ready to replace your home’s doors, and want to be sure that you’re staying on trend?</p>

        <p>We get it. In our <a href="" /doors"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">Raleigh, NC door replacement
                showroom</a>, we often talk to homeowners who want to keep up with current door trends.</p>

        <p>That’s why, in this article, we’re sharing our top three predictions for the door trends that we think will
            be everywhere in 2023.
            <img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/pinterest-2023-door-trends.jpg"" alt=""

                1000"" height="" 1500"">
        </p>

        <h2>¾ Light Doors in Black or Wood Grain</h2>

        <p>Most of the front doors we’re ordering for our customers these days are ¾ Light doors. And most of those are
            being ordered in black or wood-grain finishes.</p>

        <p>Gone seem to be the days of frequently flipping front doors to match the latest color trends. More and more
            homeowners are opting for a door that is the aesthetic equivalent of a Little Black Dress. Doors that are
            gorgeous on their own, but easy to accessorize.</p>

        <p>The ¾ Light means that up to ¾ of the door is glass. This glazing (glass) option is functional for modern
            families. It allows light into the home while also allowing families to quickly spot Amazon packages left on
            the front porch. Of course, privacy glass options mean that families don’t have to worry about neighbors
            seeing into the home.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the black or wood-grain finish serves as a neutral base. Neither will detract from or clash with
            holiday decor, planters, etc. Both also look phenomenal with black windows, which is another trend that is
            likely to continue well past 2023.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that a wood grain appearance is achievable on even a durable fiberglass door.</p>

        <h2>Multi-Panel Sliders</h2>

        <p>We won’t lie, we’re obsessed with multi-panel sliding doors that almost instantly create indoor-outdoor
            living space.</p>

        <p>Andersen’s Big Doors line includes multi-glide and bi-fold outswing doors that are as visually stunning as
            they are functional.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/patio-door-featured-.jpg"" alt=""

                width="" 1000"" height="" 600""></p>

        <p>For many homeowners, though, the price point of these impressive doors is over their budget.</p>

        <p>When that’s the case, we love to recommend four-panel gliders as a less costly alternative that has
            tremendous design impact. These doors feature four panels which can be made to slide from one side or open
            from the middle, creating a sliding glass version of a French door.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_2090.jpg"" alt="" modern minimal

                480""></p>

        <p>Since the onset of Covid, more and more homeowners have been looking for ways to make their homes a true
            retreat. These patio door options offer an easy and functional way to create instant indoor-outdoor living
            space.</p>

        <h2>Smart Locks</h2>

        <p>Smart lock technology has made great strides in the past few years. We predict that this is a door trend that
            will soon be standard in most homes.</p>

        <p>That’s because of the significant security benefits homeowners get at a relatively low cost. Smart locks cost
            not much more than their traditional keyed counterparts.</p>

        <p>Most smart locks offer smartphone app integration, meaning that family members can easily check if a door is
            open, and lock or unlock it remotely if needed.</p>

        <p>Our favorite Smart Locks incorporate biotechnology without sacrificing aesthetics.</p>

        <p>We especially love that these locks allow homeowners to use a fingerprint to open their doors.</p>

        <p>This feature is helpful if homeowners have family members who may lose a key. Or, perhaps there’s a family
            member who struggles to remember or to accurately key in a code.</p>

        <p>For these families, fingerprint-based door locks are real game-changers.</p>

            includes some specific requirements about the features of ADA-Compliant doors.</p>

        <p>The ADA only applies to businesses. But, many homeowners shopping for <a href="" /doors"" target="" _blank""
                rel="" noopener"">new front doors in the Holly Springs, NC area</a> inquire at our store about making
            their home more accessible by installing an ADA-Compliant door.</p>

        <p>Many homeowners appreciate having an accessible door, including</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Homeowners with chronic health conditions or mobility challenges</li>
            <li>Older homeowners who value the ability to age in place</li>

        </ul>

        <p>If you are in any of these categories, you may want to learn more about getting an ADA-Compliant door for
            your home. Read on to learn what you need to know.</p>

                alt="" Craftsman style front door captioned with "" Want to make your home accessible? An in-depth guide
                to getting an ADA-Compliant Door for your Home"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h3>Door Width and Maneuvering Space</h3>

        <p>To meet ADA-Compliance guidelines, a door must have clearance of at least 32 inches across when the door is
            open at a 90° angle.</p>

        <p>This clearance ensures that anyone using a wheelchair or walker is able to enter through the door without
            hitting the door.</p>

        <p>It’s also important to ensure that the area around your door includes adequate room for maneuvering.</p>

        <p>Maneuvering space allows the door user to</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Approach the door</li>
            <li>Reach the door or door hardware</li>
            <li>Open the door while remaining outside the swing of the door (if it’s a hinged door)</li>
            <li>Maneuver through the doorway</li>
            <li>Close the door behind them</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The space required varies depending on the type of door and the direction of approach:</p>

        <p>Doors that swing outward require 18 inches of maneuvering room, while doors that swing inward require 12
            inches of maneuvering room.</p>

        <h3>Door Handles</h3>

        <p>Door handles are another important consideration for accessibility.</p>

        <p>Accessible door hardware must not require more than 5 lbs. of force to operate.</p>

        <p>Handles should also be operable with one hand. They shouldn’t require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting
            of the wrist.</p>

        <p>These criteria mean that traditional round doorknobs aren’t accessible. Lever handles are most commonly used
            by homeowners wanting an accessible front door.</p>

        <h3>Low Threshold Sills</h3>

        <p>Finally, to meet ADA-Compliance, doors must have low threshholds, or they must have gradual inclines. This
            ensures that wheelchair, cane, and walker users, as well as those with impaired vision, can easily pass
            through the door.</p>

        <p>Many door manufacturers offer sill ramps, which lengthen the distance from the ground to the sill with a
            properly graded ramp.</p>

        <p><a href=""
                https://www.thermatru.com/explore-products/components-and-accessories/public-access-sill/#tab=additional-product-information""
                target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">The Therma-Tru Public Access Sill is one that homeowners frequently
                order when they want to make their doors accessible.</a></p>

        <h2>Additional Requirements Needed for ADA-Compliant Doors</h2>

        <p>Remember that true ADA-Compliance is only required for businesses. In this article, we have shared the most
            common aspects of ADA-Compliance that homeowners ask for when they want accessible doors.</p>

        <p>There are some additional features of ADA Compliance that are rarely requested by homeowners. Things like
            closing speed, for instance. Per the ADA:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>from an open position of 70 degrees, the door will take at least 3 seconds to move to a point 3 in (75
                mm) from the latch, measured to the leading edge of the door.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>We always encourage homeowners to consider whether they need a door that meets all ADA-Compliance guidelines.
            More commonly, homeowners just want a door that will be accessible for them, their family members, and their
            friends for years to come.</p>

        </p>

        <h2>Front Door Security Tip 1: Lock your Doors</h2>

        <p>Of course, the easiest way to secure your home is to keep your doors locked.</p>

        <p><a href="" https://www.adt.com/resources/how-do-burglars-break-into-houses"" target="" _blank"" rel=""
                noopener"">In fact, home security company ADT reports that over 50% of home intruders simply enter homes
                through an unlocked front or back door.</a></p>

        <p>But do you struggle to remember if you’ve locked the door? Or would you like to be able to lock the door from
            anywhere?</p>

        <p>If you answered ‘yes’ to either of those questions, we highly recommend you integrate a wireless locking
            feature into your door hardware. This will let you lock your door remotely from your mobile device, whether
            you’re on the couch in your living room or across town at your office.</p>

        <p>These smart locks come in a wide array of styles, so you’re sure to find one that suits your taste.</p>

        <h2>Front Door Security Tip 2: Install Long Strike Plate Screws</h2>

        <p>Your front door’s deadbolt is only as effective as its strike plate. The strike plate is the metal piece of
            the door frame that the deadbolt inserts into when locked.</p>

        <p>The shorter your strike plate screws, the easier it would be for an intruder to pry the plate from the frame.
            They could then disengage your deadbolt.</p>

        <p>We recommend strike plate screws that are at least 2.5 inches long.</p>

        <h2>Front Door Security Tip 3: Security Hinges</h2>

        <p>Doors typically have three hinges that they swing from. Sometimes, homeowners worry that an intruder could
            pop out the hinge pin on the front door, and enter their home by opening the door from the hinged side.</p>

        <p>But you don’t need to worry about this.</p>

        <p>That’s because on in-swing front doors, which open into your home, the hinges are on the interior of the
            front door. They aren’t accessible from outside your home.</p>

        <p>On out-swing doors, which open away from the home, the hinges are on the exterior of the door. However, this
            doesn’t pose a security risk.</p>

        <p>That’s because its industry standard for out-swing front doors to have riveted hinge pins. This design
            doesn’t allow the pin to be removed from the hinge.</p>

        <p>Most doors have three hinge sets; it’s most common for the top and bottom hinges on an out-swing entry door
            to have riveted hinge pins. This makes it impossible for a would-be intruder to remove your door from the
            frame on the hinge side.</p>

        <h2>Front Door Security Tip 4: Auxiliary Foot Lock for Sliding Patio Doors</h2>

        <p>When most people think about safety and sliding doors, they imagine a piece of dowel rod that’s been cut to
            size to lay inside the track of the sliding door.</p>

        <p>But, if your piece of wood is damaged or misplaced, your gliding door is no longer secure.</p>

        <p>That’s why we recommend that you consider a sliding patio door with an auxiliary foot lock.</p>

        <p>This stopper, which is easily operated with your foot, serves the same function as the old dowel, with some
            bonus features.</p>

        <p>These foot locks have two lock positions. This allows you to safely vent your gliding patio door without
            concern that someone could pry the door open.</p>

        <p>We think Auxiliary Foot Locks are an essential security feature. That’s why we include them standard on every
            sliding glass door that we sell.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <h2>Front Door Security Tip 5: Skip the Security Film</h2>

        <p>Many front door security tip articles recommend applying security film over the glazing (glass) parts of your
            home’s doors.</p>

        <p>However, we don’t typically recommend this.</p>

        <p>All glass on doors must be tempered to meet construction codes. Also known as ‘safety glass’, tempered glass
            is about 4 times stronger than typical glass. This means that, while not impossible, it is extremely
            difficult to break this kind of glass. If tempered glass does break, it fractures into many tiny pieces
            which still remain connected, rather than shattering into large pieces and shards.</p>

        <p>So, applying security film may be, at best, unnecessary given the strength of the glass already in your front
            doors.</p>

        <p>However, there’s an additional reason to rethink applying security film. For many door manufacturers, the
            application of certain films may void your warranty on your door.</p>

        <p>We highly recommend checking with your door’s manufacturer before applying any films to your front door. That
            way, you can confirm that you aren’t voiding the warranty.</p>

        "<p>Have you ever wished you could open your kitchen to your back porch? Or that your bedroom led to a private
            patio for morning coffee? If so, you may be wondering “<strong>Can I replace a window with a door?</strong>”
        </p>

        <p>Here in our <a href="" /doors"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">Holly Springs, NC door showroom</a>,
            this is a question we are often asked by homeowners. They recognize that replacing a window with a door is
            an obvious way to increase their indoor/outdoor living space.</p>

        <p>Luckily, the answer is nearly always yes.</p>

        <p>However, there are some important things to do (and to not do!) to ensure that your project goes as smoothly
            as possible.</p>

        <p>Read on to learn the do’s and don’ts of replacing a window with a door.</p>

        <p><img src=""

                replacing a window with a door"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>Don’t Forget to Secure a Permit</h2>

        <p>Here in the Holly Springs, NC area, adding an exterior door to a home requires pulling a permit. This step
            may seem like a hassle.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind, though, that having this construction permitted will benefit you in the long run. It will add
            value to your home and reduce headaches should you decide to sell your home in the future.</p>

        <p>More importantly, it will also help to ensure that your new door meets all building codes, and will thus be
            as safe and energy efficient as possible.</p>

        <p>This is especially important if the wall where you plan to replace a window with a door is a load-bearing
            wall.</p>

        <h2>Do Ensure you Have Adequate Clearance if you are Replacing a Window with a Hinged Door</h2>

        <p>Consider which way your new door will swing if it will be a hinged door.</p>

        <p>Be certain that there is ample room to allow for the door to swing open without hitting furniture, walls,
            etc. You should also ensure that there is adequate room for people to walk through and around the door when
            it is open.</p>

        <h2>Don’t Forget About Air Registers</h2>

        <p>You may have an air register directly below your window.</p>

        <p>If so, keep in mind that you likely do not want an air register right below a door, as this will encourage
            people to step on it.</p>

        <p>Talk with an HVAC professional about moving the register based on the proposed door placement.</p>

        <h2>Do Check for Plumbing and Electrical Wiring</h2>

        <p>Before you replace a window with a door, you need to ensure that there is no plumbing or electrical wiring in
            the wall underneath the window.</p>

        <p>Have a professional check to confirm if they will need to move any plumbing or wiring to complete your
            project. This might be a plumber and an electrician, or it could be your general contractor.</p>

                we hope will end in 2023"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>1. Using Sash Kits to Patch Failing Windows</h2>

        <p>Sash kits include an upper and lower sash and a jamb liner. The idea is that, if your window sash is rotting
            or otherwise failing, you can replace just the sashes without having to replace the whole window.</p>

        <p>This is often appealing to homeowners and handymen who aren’t experienced in window installation.</p>

        <p>However, sash kits are a window trend that we find wind up costing homeowners more money and headaches.</p>

        <p>That’s because the kits cost about the same as a replacement vinyl window. But, they don’t allow for shimming
            or other means of preventing gaps. And its likely that gaps or other installation issues are what caused the
            sashes to rot.</p>

        <p>For all these reasons, we recommend that homeowners don’t mess with sash kits if their sashes are breaking
            down. Instead, look for a reputable company that can help you find a replacement window.</p>

        <h2>2. False Dormer Windows</h2>

        <p>A dormer window is one that is built into the slope of a roof. These windows can let light into an attic or
            an upstairs bedroom.</p>

        <p>A false dormer, however, is one that is built out on top of a completed roof. From the outside, it appears to
            be a functional window. But, underneath the window is the roof, meaning that this window doesn’t allow any
            light into the home. False dormer windows are purely aesthetic from the exterior of the home.</p>

        <p>Our experience has been that false dormer windows are especially prone to moisture and rot issues because of
            their placement.</p>

        <p>We have also found that repairs or replacement of false dormer windows are quite tricky. That’s because you
            are only able to access one side of the window.</p>

        <p>This lack of access increases the cost associated with repairing or replacing these windows. These long-term
            hassles are the reason that we hope false dormers are finally on their way out in 2023.</p>

        <h2>3. Capping Old Wood Window Sills in Aluminum or Vinyl</h2>

        <p>A common suggestion to stop the deterioration of old wood window sills is to cap them in aluminum or vinyl.
        </p>

        <p>Like sash kits, we find that this recommendation typically actually accelerates the damage to the wood window
            sill. Water can infiltrate the gap between the cap and sill, and rot can set in very quickly.</p>

        <p>As an alternative to this, we suggest replacing the sill or just the sill nosing with PVC. This ensures that
            the sill will not be susceptible to moisture damage.</p>

        <p>We also recommend <a href="" /what-is-brickmould-on-a-window"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">adding
                PVC or aluminum brickmould, for additional water-tightness. </a>This will add an additional layer of
            protection to your windows, and keep them operating properly for as long as possible.</p>

        <p>Brickmould (sometimes spelled brickmold), is a casing used around a window frame on the exterior of a home.
            It is one among many options of exterior window trim (casing). Of the options available, brickmould is the
            most popular and commonly used exterior window casing.</p>

        <p>It’s true purpose is to fill the gap between the window frame and the exterior surface of the house. This
            adds an additional layer of water-tightness around your window’s rough opening.</p>

        <p>The name brickmould reflects a time when most houses were surfaced in brick. The product was a casing (mould)
            between the window and the home (brick), hence the name brickmould.</p>

        <p>However, many homeowners appreciate the visual interest that this casing adds to their windows.</p>

        <h3>Top 5 Questions About Brickmould Answered</h3>

        <h4>1. What is Brickmould Made of?</h4>

        <p>Brickmould is available in a variety of materials, including</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Vinyl</li>
            <li>Stain-grain wood</li>
            <li>Aluminum</li>
            <li>PVC composite</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here in the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina, we recommend using a material that is rot-resistant.
            Depending on which window line you are using, this may be made from Aluminum, PVC, or a fiberglass
            composite.</p>

        <p>That’s because the high humidity, heat, and sun exposure that our windows face can lead to warping or rotting
            of other brickmould materials.</p>

        <p>We find that PVC, composite, and aluminum are the most durable options for central NC homeowners.</p>

        <h4>2. What are the Benefits of Brickmould?</h4>

        <p>Brickmould extends the life of your window by adding an additional layer of security around it.</p>

        <p>Brickmould also prevents damage from moisture by preventing any gaps between your window and your exterior
            wall.</p>

        <h4>3. Is There is a Standard Brickmould, or can I Customize the Look?</h4>

        <p>If you choose to use brickmould, you are choosing an exterior casing that is 2 inches wide. The profile is
            standard, and looks like this:</p>

        <p>When it comes to customization, you can often (but not always) have brickmould customized to the same color
            as your window. You can also paint brickmould.</p>

        <h4>4. Does Brickmould Come on a New Window? Or is it Applied Separately?</h4>

        <p><a href="" /why-are-windows-so-expensive"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">Windows are custom-made at
                the time they ordered.</a> This allows each window order to made to the unique specifications that each
            homeowner wants.</p>

        <p>Brickmould is one of those specifications. Many window manufacturers offer the option to build brickmould
            onto the window frame during manufacturing.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of an Andersen E-series window with the brickmould applied during manufacture.</p>

        <p>But what if you have existing windows and want to add brickmould, or if you didn’t order it to be built onto
            the window?</p>

        <p>You still have options.</p>

        <p>Brickmould can be ordered in lengths and cut on-site and then applied to your window during or after
            installation.</p>

        <h4>5. Do I Have to use Brickmould on my Windows?</h4>

        <p>No, you do not have to include brickmould, or any casing, when you install new construction windows.</p>

        <p>When people elect not to include brickmould in their windows, it is usually for aesthetic reasons. Some
            contemporary and modern-style homeowners prefer to keep their window profiles as minimal as possible, and so
            they forego any extra casing.</p>

        <p>However, most people, even those with ultra-modern architecture, do elect to have brickmould installed.</p>

        <p>That’s because brickmould protects your windows, keeping them functional and fresh-looking for much longer
            than they would be without additional casing.</p>

        <p>If, however, you are replacing existing windows that had exterior casing, you must replace this casing with a
            similar option. That is unless you plan to have your house re-sided at the same time as your window
            replacement. Otherwise, you will expose a gap between your window and siding.</p>

        <h2>1. Water Seeps Into Your Walls</h2>

        <p>Many people watch our installation crew work and say that lifting and setting a window squarely into a frame
            must be the hardest part of the job.</p>

        <p>But, our foreman and his window installation team will tell you that caulking their finished work is the part
            of the job that requires the most skill.</p>

        <p>That’s because a poor caulk job is more than just unsightly. If you aren’t thorough and exacting in your
            caulk application, small gaps or micro-tears in the caulk job will allow water and moisture to permeate the
            seal and seep behind your window.</p>

        <p>Over time, the buildup of water around your window will penetrate your walls, leading to rot in your drywall
            and possibly in the wall studs.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, we are often called in to replace windows when homeowners see signs of moisture damage in
            their walls. In most cases, when we learn that these homeowners had attempted DIY window installation at
            some point. The culprit for their rot is usually poor caulking.</p>

        <h2>2. Your Windows Aren’t Airtight (Which Means They Aren’t Energy Efficient)</h2>

        <p>A DIY window installation may sound like a great way to save money. But, we encourage you to consider the
            costs you’ll face if your installation isn’t perfect.</p>

        <p>We know, nothing in this world can be truly perfect.</p>

        <p>But a properly installed window is the closest thing we’ve seen.</p>

        <p>A properly installed window is one that’s plum, level, and square. To achieve this precision requires
            extensive measuring across angles and planes. It also involves accurate shimming, which is a craft unto
            itself.</p>

        <p>If homeowners attempt DIY window installation and don’t achieve this ideal balance, a lot of bad things can
            happen.</p>

        <p>Their windows may:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Be hard to operate (becoming ‘stuck’ when opened)</li>
            <li>Fail to latch</li>
            <li>Allow water and moisture to enter the home</li>
            <li>Develop gaps allowing air to flow into the home</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you’ve read our <a href="" /energy-efficient-windows"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">guide to
                energy efficiency in windows</a>, you know that installation is a key component in achieving your
            window’s stated energy rating.</p>

        <p>If your window isn’t installed properly, it will not be as energy efficient as advertised. Poor installation
            of energy-efficient windows will, over time, cost more in heating expenses than a less energy-efficient
            window would cost.</p>

        <p>In short, it makes very little sense to buy an energy-efficient window and install it yourself. You are
            negating the cost savings you just paid for.</p>

        <h2>Bad DIY Window Installation Can Damage Windows Beyond Repair</h2>

        <p>In extreme cases, we have seen shoddy DIY window installations result in damage to the window unit so severe
            that the window had to be replaced.</p>

        <p>We have plenty of examples of this. Recently, we visited a homeowner who noted extreme warping of their
            windows. The corners of the unit were intact, but the window bowed out in the middle to the point that it
            was expanded beyond the casing.</p>

        <p>We learned that, during DIY window installation, this homeowner had used expandable foam during installation.
            Professional window installers know that non-expandable foam is essential to use during installation.
            Expandable foam will expand to fill any available space. This homeowner’s windows were compressed by the
            foam, and caused the window to bow.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, this homeowner’s ignorance of the right products to use during DIY installation wound up
            meaning a full replacement of all the windows in their home.</p>

        <h2>Why Replacing all your Windows at Once may Actually be Less Expensive than Just Replacing Some of your
            Windows</h2>

        <p>Before we offer that tip, though, we want to be sure you’re thinking through a few facts that may actually
            make you reconsider your choice to split your window order.</p>

        <h3>1. Window Manufacturers Raise their Rates Annually</h3>

        <p>Window manufacturers increase their prices at least annually. At the height of COVID-related materials
            shortages, we saw some window lines increase their prices monthly.</p>

        <p>Usually, though, you can count on at least one price increase in a calendar year.</p>

        <p>So, unless you plan to order the rest of your windows later in the same calendar year, you may actually wind
            up spending more by splitting your order.</p>

        <h3>3. Installation Costs May be More if you Only Replace Some of your Windows</h3>

        <p>In this article, we explained some of the reasons why windows are so expensive (LINK). Installation costs are
            a major factor in why windows may cost more than many homeowners expect. These costs include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Materials like trim, caulk, and insulation</li>
            <li>Transportation costs</li>
            <li>Dumpster fees (for disposing of your old windows)</li>
            <li>Installation crew member pay, plus insurance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many of these costs will be per job, and will not necessarily be less even if you have fewer windows
            installed.</p>

        <p>Thus, you can see that between these two factors, it may actually wind up costing you more overall to replace
            some of your windows, instead of replacing them all at once.</p>

        <h3>3. Available Window Options May Change</h3>

        <p>You should also consider the potential that a window color or even the make of window that you choose may be
            discontinued between your orders if you choose to replace your windows in batches.</p>

        <p>It may wind up costing you more to try to match a certain profile, color, or hardware option that’s been
            discontinued than it would have cost to replace all your windows at once.</p>

        <p>If you want to ensure consistency between all your windows, then ordering them all at the same time is the
            only way to guarantee this.</p>

        <h3>4. Installation Policies May Change</h3>

        <p>Splitting your window replacement project into phases means that you’ll be installing smaller groups of
            windows in each phase. While this is of course your goal, it’s important to remember that if your groups are
            too small, you may struggle to find installers who will take smaller jobs. That’s because many window
            companies have minimum amounts required for ordering and installation.</p>

        <p>This can be another factor that makes it more hassle to split your window replacement job into multiple,
            smaller phases.</p>

        <h2>If I Only Want to Replace Some of my Windows, How do I Choose Which Ones to do?</h2>

        <p>That being said, suppose you know that you want to only replace some of your windows now.</p>

        <p>Many homeowners think they should just focus on the main rooms they use when choosing to only replace some of
            their windows.</p>

        <p>Others think that they should do all the windows on the first floor first and that their second project
            should be to replace all the windows on the second story.</p>

        <p>What we actually usually recommend is that you separate your project by elevation.</p>

        <p>In construction, the elevation of your home refers to the vertical depiction of your home. An elevation
            depicts how your home would be viewed by someone approaching it on the street, or in the backyard, etc.</p>

        <p>An elevation is different from a plan (also known as a blueprint). A plan is a drawing on a horizontal plane
            showing a view from above.</p>

        <h3>Here is an example of a Plan/Blueprint:</h3>

        <h3><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/plans-blueprints.jpg"" alt="" blueprint
                plans for a house, closeup of staircase and powder room portion of plan"" width="" 1000"" height=""
                600""></h3>

        <h3>Whereas the Picture and Video Below are Both Examples of Elevations:</h3>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/plans-blueprints-1.jpg"" alt=""
                elevation sketch of a three story traditional home exterior"" width="" 1000"" height="" 600""></p>

        <p>If you want to split your window replacement project into multiple phases, you should consider the elevation
            of your home. Most homeowners instantly see the problem inherent to taking a story-by-story approach to
            window replacement. From the street, their home will look haphazard with different window styles on the same
            face of the home.</p>

        <p>We coach homeowners to look for elevation groupings that make sense as they decide how to break up their
            window replacement project.</p>

        <p>For instance, suppose the front of your home has 12 windows, but the other three sides only have 10 windows
            combined. It likely makes the most sense to replace your windows on the front of your home first, and to do
            the other three sides as a separate project at a later date.</p>

                height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>1. Top-of-the-Line Materials</h2>

        <p>From the vinyl to the glass, top-tier vinyl window manufacturers use only the best materials. In the past,
            vinyl windows were prone to warp, discolor, and become brittle with age. Now, with advances in materials and
            manufacturing, homeowners can find nearly indestructible vinyl windows that are energy efficient, too.</p>

        <p>We especially love the SunShield vinyl that ProVia uses. This vinyl meets or exceeds (depending on the
            window) the standards for strength and color retention established by the <a href=""
                https://fgiaonline.org/"">Fenestration and Glazing Industry Alliance</a>.</p>

        <h2>2. A Warranty that Won’t Let You Down</h2>

        <p>Window warranties can be tricky.</p>

        <p>Some companies will offer a ‘Lifetime Warranty’, leading homeowners to believe that their investment in their
            home is protected for the rest of their lives. But if you read the fine print, sometimes these warranties
            only cover “the expected lifetime of the window”. We’ve seen these sorts of “Lifetime” warranties cover
            windows for as little as three years!</p>

        <p>Additionally, many window warranties are not transferable if the homeowner moves. So, even if you buy a home
            with brand-new windows, the warranty protecting them may be void because you didn’t purchase the windows.
        </p>

        <p>We have found that ProVia offers some of the most robust warranties we’ve seen for vinyl windows.</p>

        <p>For most of their products, this includes a Lifetime warranty that covers the windows for the lifetime of the
            owner. This warranty also allows for one transfer and extends for the lifetime of that person. This duration
            of warranty is truly rare in the vinyl window world!</p>

        <p>Of course, you should always confirm the details of your specific window warranty with the company you’re
            purchasing from. For various products, the warranty duration may be different for the glass versus the vinyl
            for example. It’s always important to know the specific warranty limitations for the exact window you’re
            purchasing.</p>

        <h2>3. Exceptional Packaging</h2>

        <p>As a window dealer, there’s nothing worse than receiving a shipment of windows and hearing the telltale sound
            of broken glass. When windows arrive damaged, it means more headaches for homeowners in the form of
            construction delays.</p>

        <p>While it’s not a guarantee, we typically don’t see breakage during transport on windows that are packaged in
            cardboard boxes. Alternatively, we do sometimes see damage in transit to windows that are packaged with only
            shipping wrap.</p>

        <p>That’s why we recommend that customers purchase vinyl windows from companies like ProVia, who package their
            windows in boxes.</p>

        <h2>4. The Benefits of Vinyl, Without the Unsightly Seams</h2>

        <p>We talk to countless homeowners who love the durability and affordability of a vinyl window.</p>

        <p>But, they just don’t love the look of them.</p>

        <p>The top complaint is the unsightly welded sash corner that many vinyl windows feature, as shown here.</p>

        <p>We love that ProVia uses their proprietary FineLine welding process to create clean weld lines. This feature
            comes standard on ProVia’s Endure line of vinyl windows.</p>

        <h2>5. Design Options</h2>

        <p>Of course, when it’s time to replace your home’s windows, you want to find a great-looking window. That might
            mean looking for windows that come in unique sizes, or ones that offer a wide array of color options. Many
            vinyl window companies stick to white windows in stock sizes.</p>

        <p>This can make some homeowners believe that their design choices are limited if they want a vinyl window.</p>

        <p>We love to share with customers that companies like ProVia offer vinyl windows in a variety of colors and
            finishes. This lets homeowners create exactly the look they want with their new vinyl windows.</p>

        "<p><strong>Why are windows so expensive?</strong> This is the #1 question we are asked by visitors to our <a
                href="" /windows"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">Apex, NC window showroom</a>.</p>

        <p>We can understand why they’re asking. The sticker shock is real for many homeowners who are reviewing a quote
            for new windows.</p>

        <p>“It’s HOW much?! But it’s just wood and glass?!”</p>

        <p>In this article, we’ll share with you the top 8 reasons why windows cost so much.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pinterest-so-expensive-683x1024.jpg""
                alt="" Three green windows on a blue sided front porch in Chapel Hill NC captioned with "" It's how
                much?! Why are windows so expensive?"" width="" 683"" height="" 1024""></p>

        <h2>1. Customization</h2>

        <p>Windows are, for the most part, made to order.</p>

        <p>Yes, you can find a basic, builder-grade, white, vinyl, single-hung window in stock sizes available at some
            window suppliers.</p>

        <p>But, most people looking to replace their home’s windows want something more durable. They may also want
            certain features, colors, or finishes.</p>

        <p>This means that nothing can be ‘off the rack’. Instead, every window is custom-ordered and uniquely crafted
            for each individual homeowner.</p>

        <p>That degree of customization is one of the reasons why Windows is so expensive.</p>

        <h2>2. Cost of Materials</h2>

        <p>Your windows may be made of wood, vinyl, aluminum, fiberglass composite, or some combination of these
            materials.</p>

        <p>Whatever material you choose must be farmed or mined or extruded or smelted…you get the idea.</p>

        <p>Then, those materials must be constructed into your custom window. Materials resourcing and production are
            driving factors in the cost of your new windows.</p>

        <h2>3. Cost of Glass</h2>

        <p>You may be surprised to learn that glass is one of the biggest reasons why windows are so expensive.</p>

        <p>This is true now more than ever. That’s because nowadays double and even triple-pane windows are de rigueur. 
            So, there is more glass being used in windows than there was in previous generations.</p>

        <p>Additionally, to ensure that these windows are energy efficient, gasses like Argon or Krypton are inserted
            between the window panes during construction. The use of these gasses to create highly energy efficient
            windows is another factor in the cost of replacement windows.</p>

        <h2>4. The Brand of Windows you Buy</h2>

        <p>You’ve heard it before, and you know there’s truth to it:</p>

        <p><strong>You get what you pay for.</strong></p>

        <p>In the world of buying windows, you have likely seen that top brands like, Pella, Marvin, or Andersen come at
            a premium price.</p>

        <p>So, what exactly do you get from a premium window brand when you purchase at their premium price?</p>

        <p>Let’s say you buy an Andersen window. Andersen has been in business since 1903. They’ve tested a lot of
            materials in that time, and have developed some industry leading technology. The cost of a high-end window
            reflects the years of research and design that went into the development of the window you choose. Over
            time, your choice to pay a bit more for a premium window, and the R+D that led to it, will mean less
            frequent repair and replacement costs down the road.</p>

        <p>Andersen also has extensive libraries of resources for homeowners and dealers alike available on their
            website. Their pricing reflects the plethora of helpful information they make available to homeowners, which
            is something you won’t get with lower-tier window manufacturers.</p>

        <h2>5. Shipping Costs</h2>

        <p>Windows are large, heavy, and extremely fragile.</p>

        <p>Shipping them involves a ton of packaging and the time and manpower it takes to carefully secure them inside
            of large freighters. Those trucks must then transport them around the country.</p>

        <p>The gas, supplies, and time it takes to package and ship windows is a huge driver in their high cost.</p>

        <h2>6. Labor</h2>

        <p>Remember our first point, about customization being a strong factor in the high cost of windows?</p>

        <p>That customization also impacts your labor costs. At the start of your window replacement project, an expert
            in window measurement must travel to your home to measure your windows with exacting precision.</p>

        <p>Then, when it’s time for installation, the labor crew must adapt their tools and processes to install your
            unique windows in your unique home. Maybe you are having a window replaced over your front door, which
            requires scaffolding. Or perhaps you have a window that spans 6+ feet and requires multiple installers to
            set into place.</p>

        <p>Of course, labor costs may also have some other implications.</p>

        <p>For instance, here <strong>at Window Works, every member of our installation team is an employee of our
                company.</strong> We don’t mess around with hiring contractors who then hire sub-contractors to install
            your new windows.</p>

        <p>Most of our customers tell us that they don’t mind if this means that our labor costs are a few dollars
            higher than our competitors. Our customers want a job done right, and they appreciate knowing that we stand

        <h2>7. Installation materials</h2>

        <p>We’ve already discussed the cost of materials that go into your window. But, there are also costs associated
            with the materials that go around your windows.</p>

        <p>These are the products used to complete your installation, like caulk, nails, insulation, and moulding.</p>

        <h2>8. Additional Construction Costs</h2>

        <p>Ever wonder what happens to your old windows after the dump trailer hauls them away?</p>

        <p>Typically, construction materials like old windows cannot be disposed of in regular garbage dumps or even at
            some landfills. Instead, your installation crew must dispose of them at private dumps. The cost of disposing
            of your old windows is an additional reason why your new windows cost so much.</p>

        <p>One unique challenge we sometimes face is to help a homeowner replace the door on a historic home. The
            perfect replacement door will offer just the right balance of modern function and efficiency. But, it should
            not sacrifice historic charm and authenticity.</p>

        <p>Read on to learn our top 5 rules for replacing your historic home’s doors.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pinterest-historic-home-door.jpg""
                alt="" Blue Victorian historic home captioned with "" Need a new door for your old home? 5 rules for
                replacing your historic home's door"""" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>1. Know the Requirements for your Historic Area</h2>

        <p>Here in central North Carolina, your historic home may be a rural farmhouse on the outskirts of Wake County.
            In that case, your only restrictions when replacing your door are the degree to which maintaining the look
            of your historic home is important to you.</p>

        <p>But, if you live in a designated historic area, say one of <a href=""
                https://rhdc.org/raleigh-historic-resources/raleigh-historic-districts"" target="" _blank"" rel=""
                noopener"">downtown Raleigh’s Historic Districts</a>, you may have to follow written guidelines to
            replace your historic home’s doors.</p>

        <p>Before you do anything else, you must start by knowing if any changes you make to your historic home’s doors
            are governed by laws or covenants. If you live in a historic district, there may be written guidance
            outlining the changes you are (and are not) allowed to make to your home’s old doors.</p>

        <p>For instance, many historic districts require that doors must be replaced by true wood doors. They will not
            allow you to use a stained Fiberglass that mimics the look of wood. Some historic districts even prohibit
            the use of any composite materials (like vinyl or PVC) in the framing around your door or on your threshold.
        </p>

        <p>Or, there may be restrictions around the colors you can paint your door, or the glass patterns allowed if
            your door includes glazing.</p>

        <p>So, before you approach any other decisions, you should learn exactly what you can and cannot change about
            your front door.</p>

        <h2>2. Maintain Period Authenticity Beyond Colors and Materials</h2>

        <p>Most historic homeowners already know that they want to replicate the colors and materials that would have
            been original to the home as closely as possible when replacing their door.</p>

        <p>But, as you undertake to replace your historic home’s doors, you should also consider the period-authentic
            features that you want to maintain and highlight with your door replacement project.</p>

        <p>For instance, many homes built prior to the 1900s featured transoms and sidelights for practical reasons.
            These glass features allowed light in the home before electricity became common in American homes.</p>

        <p>Considering the time-period rationale for some of the design features of your door can help you to appreciate
            the history of your home. Finding ways to enhance these features will only further maintain the historical
            authenticity of your architecture and design.</p>

        <h2>3. Know that True Historical Authenticity is in the Details</h2>

        <p>As you consider all aspects of replacing your historic home’s door, know that the key markers of historical
            authenticity will be in the details.</p>

        <p>Try to find hardware finishes that mimic the finishes common to when your home was built.</p>

        <p>Or, consider glazing (glass use) that mimics the look of the windows available when your home was built. For
            many homes, this would mean truly divided lives. Modern doors are made with large pieces of glass. Two or
            three of them in conjunction create energy efficiency. Grilles may be inserted between the panes of glass to
            make them easier to clean.</p>

        <p>However, older homes would have had true divided lites. These are smaller pieces of glass inserted between
            grille frames. To replicate this look, you would choose a grille that is overlaid above your glass, rather
            than inserted between it.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/true-divided-lites.jpg"" alt="" example
                of old wood window with true divided lites"" width="" 1000"" height="" 600""></p>

        <p>Sticking is another door option that has the potential to impact the degree to which a door appears authentic
            to the time period of a home.</p>

        <p>A sticking profile is the detail between the rail and the stile of a door panel.</p>

        <p>For instance, there are two similar black doors. Both have quarter lights (glass in the top ¼ of the door),
            and two panels below.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/two-black-doors-different-sticking.jpg""
                alt="" two black doors with quarter lights showing examples of different sticking profiles"" width=""
                1000"" height="" 600""></p>

        <p>However, the door on the left mimics a traditional ovolo sticking profile, while the door on the right
            features flush glazing and square sticking, commonly known as Shaker style.</p>

        <p>You can see, despite the similarities in the door, the difference that this small change makes. It’s the
            difference between a door looking contemporary to a Queen Anne style home versus a Craftsman style home.</p>

        <h2>4. Ensure that Replacing your Historic Home’s Doors Won’t Damage Other Features of the Home</h2>

        <p>As you plan your door replacement project, be sure that the integrity of other features of your home is
            considered.</p>

        <p>For example, suppose your home has original plaster walls. Work with your door installation team to ensure
            that the integrity of the plaster won’t be compromised when the framing of the door is replaced.</p>

        <h2>5. Finally, Find a New Purpose for your Old Front Door</h2>

        <p>We love to recommend that historic homeowners consider if they can re-use their original door in another way
            in their home. Many former front doors find new life as a pantry or laundry room door.</p>

        <p>Or, if your door isn’t safe to rehang and use as a door, <a href=""

                instead)"" width="" 1000"" height="" 1500""></p>

        <h2>What is a Dutch Door?</h2>

        <p>A Dutch door is a door that is split in half horizontally. You may have only the bottom closed so that the
            top swings freely open, or you may close both halves.</p>

        <h3>Dutch Doors are known by many other names, including</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Stable doors</li>
            <li>Barn doors</li>
            <li>Double hung doors</li>
            <li>Half doors</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whatever you call them, these doors have a long history.</p>

        <p>From their name, you may not be surprised to learn that Dutch doors originated in the Netherlands.</p>

        <p>In the 1600s, these doors were popular among farming families who used them to keep children in and animals
            out. When Dutch settlers came to the US, they brought the style with them in rural parts of New England.</p>

        <p>Since then, Dutch doors have been adapted to suit many home architectural styles, from farmhouses to
            traditional and even contemporary designs.</p>

        <h2>Why you Don’t Want A Dutch Door</h2>

        <p>We can’t argue that Dutch doors are charming, and make your home instantly memorable.</p>

        <p>However, there are four reasons that Dutch doors are a poor exterior door choice for most homeowners.</p>

        <h3>1. They are Easily Damaged by Kids and Pets</h3>

        <p>One of the selling features of a split panel door is its ability to keep kids and pets in by opening only the
            top portion of the door.</p>

        <p>However, in our experience, the top edge of the bottom door panel of many Dutch doors is quickly damaged in
            homes with pets and kids. Think claws of pups eager to greet houseguests. Dents and scrapes from errant toys
            and sippy cups.</p>

        <p>Even a sturdy fiberglass door is not indestructible and will show wear from frequent battering.</p>

        <p>By giving kids and pets a ledge to try to see and maybe even climb over, you’re risking the top of that door
            edge becoming quite damaged in short order.</p>

        <h4>Dutch Doors can also Cause More Damage to Kids and Pets</h4>

        <p>We should also mention that the split in the door panel can pinch little fingers and paws if closed too
            quickly.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/featured-dutch-1.jpg"" alt="" yellow lab
                looks over the top of an opened, red, Dutch door"" width="" 1000"" height="" 600""></p>

        <h3>2. Especially in the Apex, NC Area, They Allow Bugs and Pollen into your Home</h3>

        <p>Here in central North Carolina, there’s always something in the air. In March and April, it’s the gritty
            yellow pollen that blankets every surface it touches. Then, from May till October, it’s mosquitos and damp
            humidity.</p>

        <p>Dutch doors make a lot of sense in other parts of the country with milder weather and less insect activity.
            But most Dutch door owners we know in the Apex area say they don’t open the top panel of their door nearly
            as often as they thought they would. The main reasons are usually pollen, bugs, and humidity.</p>

        <p>While it’s true you can install a retractable screen on many Dutch doors, we find that this defeats the
            overall aesthetic purpose of the door.</p>

        <p>Keep reading to learn about the door we love to recommend as an alternative to Dutch doors. The way the
            screen is incorporated is so stunning, that you’ll think of it as a design bonus rather than a necessary
            aesthetic evil.</p>

        <h3>3. Dutch Doors Cost More</h3>

        <p>This point may not surprise you, but Dutch Doors generally cost more than their single-panel counterparts.
            There are a few reasons why:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Additional hardware is needed (hinges, locks, knobs, etc.). For added security, many Dutch door owners
                will add a deadbolt to the top door panel, since the doorknob and lock are usually on the lower panel.
            </li>
            <li>An extra weathertight seal is needed between the two panels</li>
            <li>Installation is trickier and may be more costly to ensure that each piece of the door is properly plumb,
                level, and square. This may require additional installation time, shimming equipment, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Split Panels May Weather Inconsistently, Leading to Maintenance Headaches</h3>

        <p>Sunlight causes much of the weathering that damages doors here in the Carolinas. In a Dutch door, the
            two-door panels may receive inconsistent sunlight (such as if the top panel is covered by an overhang, but
            the bottom panel receives more daytime sun). It’s possible that one part of a Dutch door may begin to warp
            or show other signs of weathering before the other does.</p>

        <p>This can lead to difficulty when performing annual maintenance. For instance, it may be difficult to re-stain
            the door and get an exact color match if the panels are showing different wear patterns.</p>

        <p>More troublingly, though, the reduced surface area of the smaller panels may cause other problems. One part
            of the door may begin to warp or come out of alignment sooner than it would if a full-size door were in the
            same space.</p>

        <p>Over time, this can mean more frequent maintenance needs, and possibly even more regular replacement.</p>

        <h2>Our Favorite Alternative to a Dutch Door</h2>

        <p>So, you love the unique charm of a Dutch Door. You also like the idea of having a door that can keep little
            ones and pets indoors, while still allowing you to talk to someone outside.
            But, the additional maintenance needs and potential for damage have you convinced that a Dutch door won’t
            work for your home.</p>

        <p>Happily, we have a phenomenal alternative for you.</p>

        <p>The <a href="" https://dsadoors.com/our-doors/signature/breezeport/"">Breezeport line by DSA Doors</a> has
            all the great features of a Dutch door, without the safety and weather concerns. The built-in venting allows
            you to partially open the door without risking damage to the panel.</p>

        <p>Built in screens will keep bugs out, but they don’t detract from the look of the door. And the venting
            mechanism screams industrial chic rather than a ‘standard use feature’.
            This door offers tons of customization options (including arch tops and double doors).</p>

        <p>In short, if you’re looking for a door that’s just as winning as a Dutch door, but without the hassle of
            split panels, we think you’ll love this line.</p>

        <h2>1. Don’t Wait Too Long to Paint or Stain Your New Front Door (or the Frame Around it!)</h2>

        <p>You may be tempted to live with your new front door for a while before committing to a paint or stain color.
        </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, taking too long to make your decision might void the warranty on your new front door.</p>

        <p>That’s because most door manufacturers’ warranties are only valid if painting or staining are done very soon
            after your door is installed.</p>

        <p>How soon?</p>

        <p>Of course, it varies by manufacturer, but we’ve seen as little as two days after installation in some cases.
        </p>

        <p>Other door makers give you a bit longer to decide exactly what shade you want your new front door to be.</p>

        <p>For instance, <a href="" https://www.thermatru.com/project-center/faqs/"" target="" _blank"" rel=""
                noopener"">here’s a bit of the warranty information from one of our favorite door brands, Therma-Tru
                Doors.</a></p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>“For continued warranty coverage, all fiberglass Therma-Tru door systems must be finished within 6 months
                of installation. However, all bare or unprotected wood surfaces, such as door frames, should be primed
                and painted, or stained and top coated within the lesser of 2 weeks of installation or exposure to
                weather.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>2. Don’t Forget to Check the Ventilation on Your Storm Door</h2>

        <p>If your storm door isn’t properly ventilated, heat can become trapped between the storm door and your new
            front door.</p>

        <p>This isn’t a problem if you have a Fiberglass front door, which can withstand the extra heat without
            suffering damage.</p>

        <p>But, if your new door is wood or steel, this heat build-up can cause your door to warp, or experience a
            breakdown of the paint or stain.</p>

        <p>This can be especially true if your door gets a lot of direct sunlight. To avoid this, ensure that your storm
            door has proper ventilation.</p>

                learn more about three options for ventilating your storm door</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. Don’t Neglect to Schedule Maintenance</h2>

        <p>Whether you add a reminder to your phone, or jot it down on next year’s calendar, don’t forget to schedule
            annual maintenance for your front door.</p>

        <p>Some of our homeowners have gotten in the habit of always doing this on the same day every year.  For
            example, some choose the Saturday before Mother’s Day.</p>

        <p>Here in central North Carolina, this is an excellent time to set aside for front door maintenance. The yellow
            pollen has typically disappeared by early May, and it’s not yet too hot to do work on your home’s exterior.
        </p>

        <p>Whether you choose to keep up with your maintenance schedule on a paper calendar or online.</p>

        <p>What maintenance should you be doing? We’re so glad you asked!</p>

        <p><a href="" /the-only-exterior-door-maintenance-checklist-youll-ever-need"" target="" _blank"" rel=""

        <h2>4. Don’t Use the Wrong Materials if You’re Going to Modify Your New Front Door</h2>

        <p>You may want to add a kickplate to your new front door to guard it from unsightly scrapes and dings. Or, you
            may want to add a mail slot or a pet door.</p>

        <p>First, before you undertake any of these projects, ensure that you know whether making these modifications
            will void your door’s warranty.</p>

        <p>Then, if you do decide to proceed, be sure to use the right materials.</p>

        <p>If you are adding a peephole, mail slot, or pet door, be sure to use a product that contains a
            water-resistant inner sleeve. This will prevent moisture, debris, and even your mail (!) from falling into
            the interior space in your door panel.</p>

        <p>If you are adding a kickplate, filling any pre-drilled holes with sealant before you apply the plate will
            help to protect the door’s integrity.</p>

        <h2>5. Lastly, Don’t Forget to Re-install your Security System</h2>

        <p>If you change your front door, you’ll need to uninstall any security systems that were connected to your
            original door. This is usually easily accomplished with a quick call to your security system provider.</p>

        <p>Just don’t forget to include re-installing your security system once your new front door is in place!</p>

        </p>

        <h2>1. An Auxiliary Foot Lock</h2>

        <p>While the Triangle area of North Carolina is a safe place for families, it’s still a comfort to know that
            your home is as secure as possible.</p>

        <p>When most people think of sliding door security, they usually imagine a wooden dowel. Many people lay one
            along the track to stop the door from being pried open from the outside. You may think that this is the best
            option for keeping your sliding glass door secure.</p>

        <p>But, that piece of wood only works when you remember to put it in place. It also only works when it’s left in
            place.</p>

        <p>To that end, security is not just protecting your home from intruders looking to enter. It also means keeping
            family members securely inside if it’s not safe for them to be out of the home. That might include young
            children or grandchildren, as well as older family members with cognitive decline. Unfortunately, the dowel
            can easily be removed by a child or elderly family member who may then leave through the sliding door.</p>

        <h4>The best security solution for sliding patio doors</h4>

        <p>To prevent both scenarios, we recommend that you install an auxiliary foot lock on your new sliding glass
            door.</p>

        <p>This stopper, which is easily operated with your foot, serves the same function as the old dowel, with some
            bonus features.</p>

        <p>These foot locks have two lock positions. This allows you to safely vent your gliding patio door without
            concern that someone could pry the door open.</p>

        <p>Also, the construction of the lock prevents the door from getting racked if you try to open the door while
            it’s locked.  A door becoming racked means that its not hanging squarely in its frame. Did you ever try to
            open a sliding glass patio door while just a wooden dowel held it in place? You may remember it seeming to
            pull the door out of alignment. This is what causes racking. Over time, this can significantly impair the
            door’s functionality.</p>

        <p>We love Auxiliary Foot Locks so much that we include them as standard on every sliding glass door that we
            sell.</p>

        <h2>2. A Raised Sliding Track</h2>

        <p>Our next pick for essential sliding glass door features is a raised sliding track.</p>

        <p>Most articles about sliding glass patio doors will remind you that you need to remove debris from the track.
            Having a clean track ensures that it doesn’t rust or otherwise break down over time. That debris might
            include fallen leaves, pine needles, dirt, pet hair, pebbles, etc.</p>

        <p>But, if you pick a sliding glass door that’s constructed with a raised sliding track, you won’t need to worry
            about that level of maintenance.</p>

        <p>That’s because a raised track ensures that debris is directed away from the path that gliding rollers follow
            to allow the door to function.</p>

        <p>Homeowners love knowing that, even if they forget to examine and clean out their sliding glass door track
            after a Carolina summer storm, it’ll still work just fine.</p>

        <h2>3. A Sill Ramp</h2>

        <p>If you or a family member have mobility concerns, then a sill ramp is a must.</p>

        <p>This ramp ensures that there is a smooth transition over the raised threshold of your door. Family members
            who use wheelchairs, walkers, or canes, or who otherwise have difficulty with uneven surfaces, will
            appreciate this accessible feature.</p>

        <h2>4. A Retractable Screen</h2>

        <p>Having a screen on your sliding glass patio door is a great feature. You can enjoy seasonable weather without
            allowing mosquitos into your home.</p>

        <p>But, when not in use, standard sliding door screens rest in front of the stationary or passive door. They
            have to be positioned there so that the operable door can be opened. This can create an unpleasing visual,
            as you’re able to see the screen through the glass of one door, but not the other.</p>

        <p>A great solution to this is a retractable screen. When not in use, this screen coils neatly into a dedicated
            canister that isn’t visible from inside your home. This ensures that you have a great, unobstructed view
            through your sliding glass patio doors.</p>

        <h2>5. Top Hung Screen</h2>

        <p>Alternatively, if you elect for a standard sliding screen, you may want to ensure that it’s top-hung. This is
            a more rare feature to find, but a great one for the improved performance it allows.</p>

        <p>Traditional screens operate by sliding on a track on the ground. By contrast, top-hung screens hang from
            rollers at the top of the door frame. This prevents the screen from being blocked by debris that may buildup
            in the track…unless you heeded our advice on feature #1, and got a raised track!</p>

        <h2>Bonus tip on a Patio Door screen feature to insist upon</h2>

        <p>Some patio doors, including a few made by industry-leading designers, have a design flaw that drives us mad.
        </p>

        <p>Namely, they are designed so that the screen is on the outside of the door.</p>

        <p>You may think this is no big deal; certainly, many of the customers who visit our Cary, NC showroom initially
            aren’t sure why we find this so aggravating.</p>

        <p>But, think about what this means for your home in the muggy, buggy heat of a Central Carolina summer.</p>

        <p>Suppose in the early morning, before the heat gets too sweltering, you have the patio door open to let in
            some fresh air. You keep the screen closed to prevent bugs and other natural debris from entering your home.
        </p>

        <p>But, once you decide to close the door, you have to open the screen in order to do so.</p>

        <p>This means allowing all those mosquitos and other insects to enter your home while you step out to close the
            door. Which, in our minds, negates the purpose of having a screen in the first place!</p>

        <p>It’s a design flaw that we always advise homeowners shopping for a new patio door to be mindful of.</p>

        "<p><strong>“Can I install my own front door?”</strong> This is a question we are sometimes asked by folks <a
                href="" /doors"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">buying new doors in our Apex, NC store</a>.</p>

        <p>The short answer to this question is: Yes. With some tools, preparation, manpower, and knowledge, you can
            absolutely install your own front door. And we can understand the appeal of saving money by DIY-ing house
            projects.</p>

        <p>But, there are many compelling reasons why you may not want to. We advise our customers to hire professionals
            to install their new front doors, and here’s why.</p>

        <p><img src=""

                683"" height="" 1024""></p>

        <h2>You risk your safety when you install your own front door</h2>

        <p>New doors are heavy and big, making them awkward to lift into place if you are unfamiliar with this process.
            And to properly install a door, you must hold it in place while leveling and adjusting it. The weight of the
            door combined with the time required to align it properly make this a job with a high risk for injury.</p>

        <p>Also, to properly install your new front door, you may need to cut shims and moulding using saws and other
            power tools.</p>

        <p>The risks of injuring yourself on this project are relatively high compared with other house projects.</p>

        <p>This is the top reason that we tell homeowners not to DIY their new front door installation.</p>

        <h2>You may damage your brand-new front door trying to install it yourself</h2>

        <p>We have had more than one customer return to us, embarrassed, needing to order a second front door. In trying
            to self-install, they damaged the original panel beyond usability.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, ordering a replacement door cost them much more than paying for installation would have cost.
        </p>

        <h2>You may not align the door properly</h2>

        <p>A properly aligned door, or one that is <strong>plumb, level, and square,</strong> is a thing of beauty. It
            fits perfectly into the frame on all four sides.</p>

        <p>A plumb door does not:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Stick</li>
            <li>Squeak</li>
            <li>Refuse to lock</li>
            <li>Let in a draft</li>
            <li>Have light shining through one or more sides</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your new front door isn’t in perfect alignment, it simply won’t function properly. Over time this may cost
            you unnecessary time, money, and frustration.</p>

        <p>Our installation crew is sometimes faced with the challenge of properly aligning a door into a wall that
            isn’t plumb. The degree of exactness that this requires can’t be overstated.</p>

        <p>If you wouldn’t describe yourself as meticulous, patient, and precise, then you may not want to install your
            own front door!</p>

        <h2>You may lose all the energy savings you just paid for</h2>

        <p>Have you read our <a href="" /energy-efficient-door"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">guide to choosing
                an energy-efficient front door</a>? If so, then you know that installation is the great decider of how
            energy-efficient your door actually is.</p>

        <p>Even the door with the best energy rating will ultimately cost you energy savings if it’s not installed
            correctly.</p>

        <p>Over time, an improperly installed door may cost you more in energy savings than paying an installation team
            would have cost.</p>

        <h2>There are just some secrets that only the pros know</h2>

        <p>We’ve learned a lot since we first started installing doors for Apex, NC homeowners back in 2007.</p>

        <p>For instance, we’ve learned that the best caulk for a new door isn’t the standard door caulk that you’ll find
            recommended by most big box stores. Instead, we have found that high grade, expansion-resistant silicone
            caulk is the best material to ensure that new doors function perfectly. This caulk helps doors retain their
            energy efficiency, even with the temperature swings and high humidity we see here in central North Carolina.
        </p>

        <p>At every step of the process, there are trade secrets like this that the average homeowner doesn’t know.</p>

        <h2>Bonus reason number 6: Not having to deal with the old front door!</h2>

        <p>If you hire a professional installation crew, they have to do all the cleanup and haul away your old door and
            all the construction debris.</p>

        <p>Going the DIY route means you’ll also need to be able to dispose of your old door. For many homeowners, this
            hassle alone makes hiring a professional installation team well worth the cost.</p>

                patio door? Top 10 questions about patio doors answered"""" width="" 683"" height="" 1024""></p>

        <h2>1. What affects the cost of a patio door?</h2>

        <p>Not surprisingly, this is one of the most common questions about patio doors that we are asked.</p>

        <h3>Four main factors can affect the cost of a new patio door:</h3>

        <p><strong>Size:</strong> Generally, larger doors tend to cost more because they require more material to make
            and more labor to install.</p>

        <p><strong>Glass:</strong>Glass is the main factor in the cost of a patio door. The more glass a door includes,
            and the more ornate the glass, the more expensive a door will be, generally speaking.</p>

        <p>Low-E and other energy-efficient glass options will also cost more than less energy-efficient glass. But,
            keep in mind that you may wind up spending more if you go with low-energy options. That’s because, over
            time, you will spend more on doors that have poor energy efficiency. You can <a href=""
                /energy-efficient-door"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">read this article for more guidance about
                buying energy-efficient doors</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Security features:</strong> Security is an important feature of exterior doors. The standard lock on
            most patio doors is a double-bore lock. This has two holes; one for a handle set, and one for a deadbolt. If
            you want additional security, at a slightly higher price, you can invest in a multipoint lock system.</p>

        <h2>2. Should I get a hinged or sliding/gliding patio?</h2>

        <p>When considering adding or replacing a patio door, this is one of the first decisions you’ll need to make.
            You should know that sliding and gliding are interchangeable terms for the same type of door.</p>

        <p>A hinged door may be a single door that swings in or out.</p>

        <p><img src=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/400_Series_Tilt-Wash_Double-Hung_Windows_Frenchwood_Hinged_Patio_Door_11545.jpg""

                height="" 600""></p>

        <p>Or, it may refer to a double-hinged door, like a French door.</p>

        <p><img src=""
                https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/200_Series_Hinged_Inswing_Patio_Door_498-769x1024.jpg""

                width="" 450"" height="" 600""></p>

        <p>Alternatively, you may choose a sliding door, which operates on a track. This is at minimum a double door,
            but you may also have additional panels added.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Anderson-Photo-4-copy-1024x683.png""
                alt="" sliding glass door to big backyard patio"" width="" 900"" height="" 600""></p>

        <p>However, you may also choose a stack and slide option, where multiple sliding doors can stack into each other
            to create a large door opening.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/patio-door-featured-.jpg"" alt=""
                Andersen black multiglide door creates indoor outdoor living space between a living room and a patio""
                width="" 1000"" height="" 600""></p>

        <p>There are a few key factors in deciding which option is right for you. As a rule, sliding doors can be made
            larger. If your vision includes ample indoor/outdoor living space, then this may be the option that best
            meets your needs.</p>

        <p>Sliding doors can also offer a bit more flexibility because they don’t require clearance. Alternatively, if
            you opt for a hinged door, then you’ll need to be certain that you have adequate clearance on both sides of
            the door to allow it to open without bumping into furniture.</p>

        <h2>3. If I choose a double door, will both doors operate?</h2>

        <p>If you do opt for a double door, then you’ll need to also decide whether you want both doors to be operable,
            or if you want one to remain stationary.  A stationary door is one that cannot ever be opened. It may be
            better thought of as a window that mirrors the look of your operable door.</p>

        <p>Whether you choose a hinged or sliding door, if you have more than one door, you’ll need to make this
            decision.</p>

        <p>In our humble estimation, we can’t think of a compelling reason to choose a stationary door.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that you can choose to have a passive door in addition to your door that operates. A passive
            door is affixed to the astragal (the hardware between two doors that seals the gap between them when they
            are closed). But, a passive door can be opened by unlatching a lock, usually at the top of the door.</p>

        <p>Given the practicality of having the option to open both doors (such as if you’re moving large furniture or
            appliances), we usually recommend that people choose an operable or passive door over a stationary door.</p>

        <p>Note that none of these options changes the cost of the door.</p>

        <h2>4. Can you replace a sliding door with a hinge door, and visa versa? What about replacing a window with a
            patio door?</h2>

        <p>If you have the clearance space to allow for a hinged door, it is very easy to exchange a sliding door with a
            hinged door. The reverse is also true; it is not difficult to swap out a hinged door for a sliding door.</p>

        <p>Replacing a window with either type of door usually means making a larger rough opening than what is
            currently there. Unless your window went down to the floor, this will require opening the sheetrock and
            adjusting the framing of the studs and plates around where the door will go.</p>

        <p>Thus, we would say that it is certainly possible to turn a window into a door, but that it may cost more than
            just replacing a door with a door due to the increased labor requirement.</p>

        <h2>5. Is a steel door the strongest patio door?</h2>

        <p>Many of our customers believe that a steel door is the strongest option there is when it comes to patio
            doors.</p>

        <p>But maybe Superman should have called himself the ‘Man of Fiberglass’ because Fiberglass is actually the most
            durable option you have for patio doors.</p>

        <p>Because of how easily it is dinged and marred, we actually see that steel is the least durable option for a
            patio door.</p>

        <h2>6. What color sill/threshold should I get?</h2>

        <p>This is one of the questions about patio doors that no one thinks about until we call their attention to it.
        </p>

        <p>Typically, customers want the sill, or the piece of the door that you step on when you cross the threshold,
            to match their handle set and hinges, if applicable. Thus, it’s important that you know what color sill you
            want when ordering your new patio door.</p>

        <h2>7. Do patio doors have tempered glass?</h2>

        <p>Yes!</p>

        <p>The <a href="" https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IRC2021P1"">International Residential Code (IRC) for One-
                and Two-Family Dwellings</a> is a comprehensive code that compiles all building requirements for
            residential homes into one convenient code. IRC sets certain building codes that specify where tempered
            glass should be installed in a home to prevent injury or death.</p>

        <p>According to the IRC, “all glass panels in fixed, sliding, swinging, operable, or bifold doors should have
            tempered glass or laminated glass installed.”</p>

        <p>This means that the glass elements of all patio doors, regardless of whether they operate, must be tempered.
        </p>

        <p>So, you don’t need to worry about family members or pets injuring themselves if they accidentally run or fall
            into the glass by accident. Rest assured that the glass of your patio door will be tempered to prevent
            serious injury.</p>

        <h2>8. Do patio doors come in standard sizes?</h2>

        <p>There are a few ‘standard’ patio door widths for double doors, and these are 60″ or 72″ (5 or 6 feet across,
            respectively).</p>

        <p>However, it’s important to know that, because of the high degree of customization available with patio doors,
            it’s very likely that the door you order may be a different size than the door you’re replacing.</p>

        <p>That’s why it’s important to work with an installation team you trust, to ensure that you approve of how they
            plan to address this difference in size with moulding or siding.</p>

        <h2>9. How can I protect my privacy through my new patio door?</h2>

        <p>Patio doors are great for enjoying the view of your yard and letting natural light fill your home. But, patio
            doors with lots of glass may prevent a challenge when you want some privacy. Luckily, you have an array of
            options when it comes to getting the privacy you want from your new patio doors.</p>

        <p>You can choose from a variety of obscured glass options to prevent others from being able to see into your
            home. However, this also means that you won’t have a clear view through the door or doors either.</p>

        <p>If you want to be able to see out clearly, your best bet might be window coverings or blinds. <strong>We’re
                especially partial to blinds between the glass for patio doors</strong>. This option allows you to have
            a full-light door when you want one, but to lower the blinds and create privacy whenever you like. It’s an
            additional bonus that kids and pets can’t damage the internal blinds.</p>

        <h2>10. What’s the maintenance like on patio doors?</h2>

        <p>Patio doors are generally low maintenance, but there are some important things you should do to keep them
            operating well.</p>

        <p>If you have a sliding patio door, you should ensure that the tracks stay clean and clear of debris. Though,
            if you have an Andersen patio door, you won’t have to worry about this. Their sliding tracks are engineered
            and raised to prevent debris buildup, which is a definite plus for busy homeowners who want fewer
            maintenance hassles.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, if you have a hinged door, ensure that the hinges stay fixed with periodic tightening.</p>

        <p>With any exterior door, you’ll want to monitor the weatherstripping and ensure that you replace it if it
            shows signs of excess wear (usually every 3-5 years).</p>

        <p>And of course, you’ll want to be sure to clean the glass regularly, so that you can really enjoy that
            spectacular view!</p>

                the Morrisville, NC area</a> often ask us <strong>“Do I have Andersen windows?”</strong></p>

        <p>Here’s the foolproof guidance that we give them to help them figure it out quickly.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pinterest-do-i-have-aw-683x1024.jpg""

                with 'How to find out in under a minute: ""Do I have Andersen windows""?"""" width=""683"" height=""1024""></p>

<h2>The quickest way to figure out if you have Andersen windows</h2>

<p>Simply look at your window’s glass. Specifically, from inside your home, look at the lower right-hand corner of the glass.</p>

<p>You may need to look quite closely.</p>

<p>But if you have Andersen windows, you’ll see the Andersen AW logo etched into the glass.</p>

<p>Here’s an example.</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AW-logo-on-windw.jpg"" alt=""Andersen window logo etched into glass"" width=""581"" height=""640""></p>

<p>On double hung windows, also known as up-and-down windows, both pieces of glass will have the etching.</p>

<h2>The history of Andersen’s window identification</h2>

<p><img src=""https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Andersen_Lumber_1903.jpg"" alt=""Historic photo from 1903 of eight men outside of a large building labeled ""Andersen Lumber"""" width=""978"" height=""556""></p>

<p>Andersen has been around for a long time; since 1903 to be exact.</p>

<p>Andersen has been etching its window glass since at least as far back as September 1962, and possibly earlier.</p>

<blockquote><p>Fun fact, <a href=""http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00678.xml"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">we went digging in the Minnesota Historical Society’s archival records on Andersen to nail down that exact date</a>. <strong>We’re THAT nerdy about windows</strong>!</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, for most homeowners, looking for the glass etching is the fastest, easiest way to tell if they have Andersen windows.</p>

<h3>How would I know if I had older Andersen windows, made pre-1962?</h3>

<p>What if you have very old windows? How could you figure out if they were Andersen windows even if they were made before Andersen started etching the window glass?</p>

<p>It can be trickier to identify older Andersen windows, but there are still some ways you can figure it out.</p>

<p>Even before they began etching window glass, Andersen would sometimes stamp their company name into hardware pieces. Seeing the Andersen name stamped into your window lock is another way to confirm if your older windows were made by Andersen.</p>

<p>The other information you can use as a clue to answer the question<strong>“Do I have Andersen windows?”</strong> is the material your windows are made from. Typically though, this information will help to identify windows that aren’t Andersen.</p>

<p>For instance, in May 2005, Andersen bought Eagle Windows. With this purchase, Andersen began manufacturing aluminum-clad windows as part of their main product lines. Previously, Andersen had briefly made one aluminum-clad product in the early 1990s (the DC tilt-wash), but did not regularly produce anything aluminum-clad. So, if you have windows that predate May 2005, and they are aluminum-clad, you can be almost certain that they are not Andersen windows.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you have an all-vinyl window, you don’t have an Andersen window. Andersen has only ever made vinyl-clad windows. These windows are all-wood windows covered by vinyl on the exterior. If there is vinyl on the interior of your window as well, then it is not an Andersen product.</p>

<h2>Other questions that customers have when they’re asking “Do I have Andersen windows?”</h2>

<h3>Is it possible that someone removed the Andersen logo?</h3>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>The logo is not a decal or other material placed on top of the glass. Rather, Andersen etches it into the glass.</p>

<p>No one can wash or peel it off; it’s permanent.</p>

<h3>Will I be able to see the Andersen logo if my windows have privacy glass?</h3>

<p>Privacy glass has a texture, tint, or design to provide privacy.</p>

<p>However, a window with privacy glass will usually include only one pane of textured glass. The other one or two panes will be clear glass. This means that you can still see the logo etched into the glass. It may help to use a flashlight, a magnifying glass, or a piece of dark paper behind the glass to help you see the logo clearly.</p>

"<p>If you’re like many <a href=""/windows"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">homeowners buying new windows</a>, you’re a first-time window buyer. It makes sense that you may be wondering “<strong>What do I need to do to prepare my home for window installation?</strong>”</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/pin_5-Steps-to-Get-Ready-for-Window-Installation-Day-683x1024.jpg"" alt=""Three men replacing the second story windows of a yellow house captioned with ""purchased new windows? 5 critical steps to get ready for window installation"""" width=""683"" height=""1024""></p>

<h3>1. Know that weather may prevent your window installation from happening as scheduled</h3>

<p>It’s unfortunate, but important, to remember that your window project may need to be rescheduled in the event of severe rain or icy conditions.</p>

<p>This is in part to protect the installation crew. It would be unsafe for them to do their jobs in these conditions (for instance, using power tools or climbing ladders in the rain).</p>

<p>Rescheduling for a dry day also benefits homeowners. That’s because installing windows on a rain and ice-free day ensures that your home will remain comfortable and moisture-free.</p>

<h3>2. Contact your home security company</h3>

<p>Home security systems commonly include window sensors. If yours does, you will need to contact your security system provider to let them know that you are having your windows replaced.</p>

<p>They can guide you through the steps to take to properly disable your alarm system.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to schedule a time to reinstall your security system after your window replacement project is complete. That way, you can ensure that your alarm system sensors are working properly with your new windows.</p>

<h3>3. Remove items that are near the construction site</h3>

<p>Before your installation appointment, please move items away from the construction sites.</p>

<p><strong>Our guiding principle is that if an item near your windows is:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Breakable,</li><li>Valuable (including having sentimental value),</li><li>Directly in the way of the window replacement project,</li><li>Difficult to clean, or</li><li>Hard to replace</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be removed and stored in a safe area away from the windows being replaced.</p>

<p>These items might include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wall hangings such as pictures, mirrors, diplomas, shelves, or other hanging decor</li><li>Furniture or light fixtures</li><li>Window coverings, including <strong>blinds, curtains, and curtain rods</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Make a plan for your pets, young children, and home-based workers on the day of installation</h3>

<p>This aspect of preparing for a window replacement project can’t be overlooked.</p>

<p>While we install your new windows, your home will have uncovered window and door openings. Crew members will be going in and out of the house. Multiple tools will be in the area. Hopefully, you agree with us that these conditions might be dangerous for pets or young children!</p>

<p>Window installation is also a loud process. This can be scary to both pets and kids (not to mention being terribly disruptive to nap-time!).</p>

<p>Be sure that your kids and pets stay safe and secure during your window replacement project by finding another place for them to spend the day.</p>

<p>Of course, here in the Raleigh, NC area, many professionals work from home full-time. If you do, you may find that the sounds of windows being removed and replaced is drowning out the Zoom meetings you need to focus on.</p>

<p>In addition to making plans for your kids and pets, you may also want to find an alternate place to spend the day yourself if you need a quiet workspace.</p>

<h3>5. Get ready for window installation by preparing a space for the crew to work</h3>

<p>Finally, know that the crew installing your new windows will need a place to work and store equipment. The ideal space for this is flat and has access to an electrical outlet.</p>

<p>This will ensure that the crew can set up all the equipment they need to complete your project as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Your window installation crew will also need space to park multiple vehicles. This includes a large dump trailer, which will be used to remove your old windows and other construction waste.</p>

<p>If you are replacing many windows in a multi-day project, you will need to identify a secure, dry space to store the windows being installed overnight.</p>

<p>Most homeowners clear an area in a garage or carport for this purpose.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>These days, we’re calling the E-series <strong>”the Window Worth Waiting for.”</strong> More than any
                other window we carry, this window has been impacted by Covid-caused supply chain delays. Our customers
                have been willing to wait though, because they love this window for all the customization options it
                offers. The E-series is the Burberry trench coat of windows. Sure, it represents an initial investment.
                But, it’ll always be in style, and if you care for it, it’ll last forever.*</p>

        <h3>What Window Works loves about the Andersen A-series window</h3>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Some window buyers are quite thoughtful about design. They want a window to highlight their home’s unique
                architecture. When we meet them, we know they’ll love the A-series. This window complements and elevates
                home styles from Acadian to Victorian (that’s as close as we could get to Z!). If you know your

            align with the new window.)</p>

                100-series. It’s a fantastic product for thrifty homeowners who want a well-functioning, good looking
                window. It’s also a great option for homeowners who don’t want to spend a lot of time making decisions.
                If you aren’t looking for a significant amount of customization, then this could be the window for you.
                This window is like a great plain white T-shirt. Unfussy, easy to match, and affordable.</p>

        "<h2>Seeing fog between the windows in your home? Learn what caused it and how to get rid of it here.</h2>

        <p>In this post, we’ll share everything you need to know about fog between the windows. Our customers <a href=""
                /windows"" target="" _blank"" rel="" noopener"">buying windows in the Apex, NC</a> area have a lot of
            questions about moisture between the window panes.</p>

        <p>If you’ve ever wondered what causes this condensation, how to fix it, and how to prevent it, then keep
            reading!</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Pinterest-fog-683x1024.jpg"" alt="" A
                window with seal failure captioned with "" Moisture between the panes? What to do about foggy
                windows?"""" width="" 683"" height="" 1024""></p>

        <h2>Why is there fog between the widows?</h2>

        <p>Double or triple-pane windows have two or three panes of glass, respectively.</p>

        <p>Between the panes of glass is a spacer that is usually made of aluminum or foam. During manufacturing, glass
            is placed on either side of the spacer and then sealed into place.</p>

        <p>Over time, the seal can break down, or fail (more on what causes this in a bit).</p>

        <p>This <strong>seal failure allows air and moisture to flow and become trapped between the panes of
                glass.</strong></p>

        <h2>Is it a problem that my windows are foggy and have condensation between the glass?</h2>

        <p>Sure, it’s unsightly. But beyond aesthetics, is it really so bad that there’s fog between the panes of your
            windows?</p>

        <p>What’s important to remember is that the fog itself is not the problem. The foggy condensation is a symptom
            of the real problem you need to address, which is the seal failure.</p>

        <p>As the weather changes, the condensation may come and go based on weather conditions.</p>

        <p>This is certainly relevant for Window Works Co’s customers. At the time we’re writing this post, we’re
            expecting a temperature swing of 50 degrees over the next three days here in Apex, NC.</p>

        <p>But, the fact remains that you’ve seen fog between the window panes at some point. This tells us that,
            whether or not the windows are foggy right now, you have permanent seal failure.</p>

        <p>In many double or triple-hung windows, inert gasses like Argon or Krypton are added between the panes of
            glass. The gas minimizes the transfer of heat through window and improves the insulation of your home.</p>

        <p>If your window has seal failure, these gasses are no longer between the panes of the window. Thus, your
            window is not as efficient as it was designed to be.</p>

        <p>Over time, the impact of seal failure can become more severe. Eventually, windows may warp, crack, or
            collapse without the inert gasses in place.</p>

        <h2>How do I repair the seal failure that’s causing fog between my window panes?</h2>

        <p>You have two options to repair the seal failure:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>You can replace the whole window.</li>
            <li>Or, you can repair just the glass unit affected by the seal failure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Here are five questions to ask yourself to help you decide if you should replace the whole window or just
            repair the glass.</h2>

        <h3>1. What is the condition of the window? Is there any wood rot on the sashes, panels, or frames?</h3>

        <p>If not then replacing the glass is probably the best option. If there is rot, then it is time to consider
            replacing the window or door.</p>

        <h3>2. Does the window operate well? Can you open and close the unit easily? Does it still close tightly?</h3>

        <p>If the window operates well, then replacing the glass might be the best option. If you answered ‘no’ to any
            of these questions, it’s probably time to replace the window.</p>

        <h3>3. Is replacing the glass cost-prohibitive?</h3>

        <p>In most cases, replacing just the glass is more economical than replacing the entire unit.</p>

        <p>However, older windows may have True Divided Lites. In this type of window, each small piece of glass is
            separate from the others that make up the window unit.</p>

        <p>If one True Divided Lite window develops multiple seal failures, replacing each one can add up and become
            costly.</p>

        <p>This is a rare situation in which replacing the window may be the more cost-effective option.</p>

        <h3>4. How old are the windows and what is the possibility they will fail soon?</h3>

        <p>Suppose your windows are 20+ years old and are made of wood.</p>

        <p>It may not make financial sense to repair the seal failure now only to replace the whole window in the next
            few years. It may be more economical to replace the whole window now.</p>

        <h3>5. Is a glazier able to repair the seal failure?</h3>

        <p>A glazier is a professional who repairs glass and corrects seal failures. A glazier can help you decide what
            options are available in your circumstances.</p>

        <p>Here in Cary, NC, we recommend <a href="" http://www.window-wise.com"" target="" _blank"" rel=""
                noopener"">Window Wise</a> for homeowners in need of a glazier.</p>

        <p>In some cases, they may not be able to repair the seal failure and may recommend that you replace the window.
        </p>

        <h2>What you should NOT do if you see moisture between the panes of your windows</h2>

        <p>We have heard many DIY options that people have tried to repair foggy windows over the years.</p>

        <p>Usually, the well-meaning people recommending these solutions are focused on ‘making the moisture disappear’.
            But remember, these solutions ultimately won’t fix the underlying problem, which is the seal failure.</p>

        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Place a dehumidifier next to the foggy window to remove the moisture.
            <strong>Problem with this recommendation:</strong> While this won’t damage your window, it likely won’t have
            much impact, either. The dehumidifier can’t be directed between the panes of glass, which is where the
            excess moisture is. It’s also not going to prevent future window fogginess, since as you know, it’s the seal
            failure that’s the real problem.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Drill a small hole at the top of the window. Use a drain snake or hanger
            wrapped in fabric to clean inside the window.
            <strong>Problem with this recommendation:</strong> Homeowners should not attempt this. Without training,
            they are likely to break the glass in their window if they attempt to drill near it. Also, as you already
            know, this does not prevent future moisture buildup between the window panes.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Drill a small hole at the top of the window. Use a dropper to drip a few
            drops of alcohol into the space between the glass to evaporate the moisture.
            <strong>Problem with this recommendation:</strong> This method may look similar to what a glazier will do to
            repair seal failure. But, it’s again important to note that without proper training and tools, homeowners
            are very likely to cause permanent damage to their windows attempting this. Glaziers use cleaning and drying
            agents that are formulated specifically for windows. These specialty products are much more effective than
            alcohol. They also know how to repair the holes they drill so that you won’t see fog between the windows
            again.
        </p>

        <h2>Tips to avoid getting fog between the windows in the future</h2>

        <p>You may be wondering how to avoid getting moisture between your window panes in the future.</p>

        <p>It may help to know what specifically causes seal failure. The main cause of seal failure in windows is
            <strong>solar (thermal) pumping</strong>. This is the process of variable sunlight causing window glass to
            expand and contract.</p>

        <p>Over time, this change in the size of the glass applies inconsistent pressure to the seal. Eventually, this
            change in pressure causes seal failure.</p>

        <p>For this reason, windows that are exposed to direct sunlight on southern or western-facing exterior walls may
            be more likely to experience seal failure.</p>

        <p>In addition to weather conditions, there are other factors that can contribute to seal failure. These
            include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Low-quality glass</li>
            <li>Incorrect window installation. This is one of the reasons that <a href=""

            <li>A home’s foundation settling</li>
            <li>Damage to the seal during painting (either from heat gun or chemical application)</li>

        "<h1>Seven signs it’s time to replace a wood front door</h1>

        <p>You may be wondering what are the signs when it’s time to replace a wood front door. Many of our customers
            have used this list to help them decide if it’s <a href="" /doors"" target="" _blank"" rel=""
                noopener"">time to upgrade a wood front door in Holly Springs, NC.</a></p>

        <p>From changes in the way the door functions to subtle signs of damage, here are eight signs that it’s time to
            replace a wood front door.</p>

        <p><img src="https://www.windowworksnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pin_replace-wood-door-683x1024.jpg""
                alt="" A wood front door on a craftsman style home. Caption reads "" Shopping for new doors? Seven signs
                it's time to replace a wood front door."""" width="" 683"" height="" 1024""></p>

        <h2>1. Signs of water damage may mean it’s time to replace a wood front door</h2>

        <p>If you notice dark streaks coming up from the bottom of your door, your door panel may have moisture damage.
        </p>

        <p>Likewise, recognizing that the bottom of your wood door is a slightly darker color than the top portion could
            mean the same thing.</p>

        <p>This kind of water damage cannot be corrected, and over time can lead to rot and breakdown.</p>

        <p>Water damage of this kind is a definite sign that you should replace your wood front door.</p>

        <h2>2. Feel a draft? That’s another indicator that you may need to replace a wood front door</h2>

        <p>If you feel airflow from outdoors coming into your home through your front door, it may be time for a change.
        </p>

        <p>This draftiness means that your home isn’t as energy efficient as it should be.</p>

        <p>Replacing your failing wood front door can mean saving on your energy bill.</p>

        <p>That’s especially true if you replace it with a fiberglass-clad front door. These are generally more
            energy-efficient than wood front doors.</p>

        <h2>3. Light coming in, either through or around the door panel, may mean it’s time for a change</h2>

        <p>If you see light coming in through the panel, it means that your door panel is cracked.</p>

        <p>This is a signal that your door is no longer energy efficient. However, it may also mean that your door panel
            is more vulnerable to further damage. Critically, this makes it a potential safety risk.</p>

        <p>Or, you may notice light coming in from between the panel and the door frame.</p>

        <p>There are many issues that can cause this. Some can be easily repaired, like replacing weather stripping.</p>

        <p>Other times though, the issues may be more integral. In these cases, the only solution to maintain your
            home’s energy efficiency is to replace the door.</p>

        <h2>4. Rotting wood is a definite sign that it’s time to replace a wood front door</h2>

        <p>It may be easier to feel for signs of rot than it is to look for them. If you touch your door and notice that
            some areas feel softer and have more give, your front door may have rot damage.</p>

        <p>Here in the Raleigh area of North Carolina, our annual average humidity is a whopping 70%. Because of this,
            wood doors in our area are especially prone to rot.</p>

        <h2>5. Cracks or damage to the door panel means that you should replace a wood front door</h2>

        <p>If your door has sustained damage, it may be more vulnerable to further breakdown in the area of the damage.
            This kind of damage may be due to pets, being banged into, or weather events.</p>

        <p>If the damage is significant, you may want to consider replacing your wood door at the outset if the damage
            can’t be repaired. This ensures that your home stays secure and energy efficient.</p>

        <h2>6. You should replace warping wood doors</h2>

        <p>The excessive heat and humidity we see in the Holly Springs area are to blame for causing warped wood doors.
        </p>

        <p>Over time, warped doors may refuse to close and lock. This is an obvious safety concern and should be
            addressed immediately.</p>

        <h2>7. Finally, if you’re just tired of your wooden front door, you should consider replacing it</h2>

        <p>Maybe you’ve just grown tired of the style of your old wood front door.</p>

        <p>Does your front door feature dated stained glass? Perhaps an outdated grille pattern? Or maybe you’re just
            sick of the boring, builder-grade flush panel?</p>

        <p>Sometimes you just have to let go of a door that no longer suits your taste.</p>

        <p>Take advantage of this opportunity to have a major impact on your home’s curb appeal with one simple change.
